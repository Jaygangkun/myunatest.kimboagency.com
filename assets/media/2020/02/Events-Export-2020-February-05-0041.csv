<strong>The 2020 UBC Farm Practicum in Sustainable Agriculture is now accepting applications!</strong>
<div class=""entry-content"">
<div>

The UBC Farm Practicum can be taken as either a seven-month (April – October), or as a five-month (April – August), experiential-learning program.  The program is part-time (approximately 20 hours per week), and is designed for aspiring farmers, urban gardeners, environmental educators, and students with an interest in applying their learning about sustainable agriculture and food systems. The program is often taken as a non-credit Certificate program; however, <u>6-9 academic credits are available</u> for interested students.

Participants gain a deeper understanding of agricultural management and small-scale farming, and a network of incredible people to support them along the way.  The main approach to learning within the program is hands-on practice.  Participants carry out seasonal farming activities with leadership provided by UBC Farm staff in the greenhouses, gardens, fields, orchards, and at our farmers’ markets. In addition, the program includes numerous guest speakers, field trips to various farming operations within the province, and access to a plot at the UBC Farm for individual and shared production.

The UBC Farm is a 24-hectare gem, the largest urban farm in Vancouver, British Columbia, and situated on a site with numerous research, educational, and community outreach activities.

Please see the UBC Farm Practicum website for detailed information and access to the online application:

Join us for a concert featuring internationally celebrated musicians, among them members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra paired with scientific insights from researchers, Faculty of Medicine, UBC.

The idea of combining music and medicine into the “Sounds &amp; Science” – scientific concert series started in 2008, when the Austrian violinist Rainer Honeck played Bach’s Chaconne in d-minor directly before a keynote lecture, held by Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, at the Austrian Society of Allergology and Immunology’s yearly meeting in Vienna. The experience at that lecture was remarkable, truly a special moment. Attendees of the “Sounds &amp; Science” series have also described that music opens the mind, and enables a better understanding of concepts in life and thereby science in general.

The November 30th program features music by classical music composers Mozart, Schubert, Strauss, Brahms and Shostakovich. Interspersed with lectures on Infectious Disease, Life Sciences, Healthy Aging and the Future of Cancer Research."

<strong>Lecture abstract:</strong>

Professor Ketelaar will draw on his most recent research into the concepts of the barbarian and the frontier in the construction of Japanese national identity and history; coupled with this he will examine something of the roles and meanings of emotion in the construction of the historical imagination in Japan. All of which will be used in a critical approach to the area known as Japan Studies.

<strong>About the John Howes Lecture in Japanese Studies: </strong>

John Howes was a founding member of UBC’s Department of Asian Studies, which he joined in 1961 after earning his doctorate from Columbia University. During his 30 years of active teaching and research, Professor Howes was at the forefront of Canada-Japan cultural, educational and people-to-people relations and inspired countless young Canadians to dedicate their careers and lives to the Canada-Japan relationship in one way or another. In 2012, a number of UBC faculty, staff, and Professor Howes’ devoted former students came together to launch an endowment in his honour. The fund supports the <a href=""https://asia.ubc.ca/the-inaugural-john-howes-lecture-in-japanese-studies/"">John Howes Lecture in Japanese Studies</a>, an annual public lecture for prominent scholars from around the world to speak to the university community and alumni on topics in Japanese Studies with a focus on Humanities. Dr. Howes passed away peacefully on February 4th, 2017, at the age of 92.

UBC Botanical Garden is a magical place in early spring, in large part because of its extensive conservation collection of flowering Magnolias. The largest of Magnolia flowers are found on the Asian deciduous species, their selections and hybrids. Magnolias in this group produce flowers on naked stems in very early spring, before leaf emergence. This group is particularly well represented in the David C. Lam Asian Garden and plants in bloom—many of which are large trees, 10m tall or more—typically elicit much picture taking and gasps of pleasure by garden visitors.

Join Douglas Justice (Associate Director, Horticulture and Collections) for a special one-hour tour of the magnificent magnolia trees planted throughout the Garden.

8937,"Members Tour: David C. Lam Asian Garden","<strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, March 26, 2020
<strong>Time:</strong> 3 pm – 4 pm
<strong>Location: </strong>UBC Botanical Garden, 6804 SW Marine Drive, Vancouver BC
Please meet the tour guide, Andy Hill, under the ginkgo tree at the entrance to the Asian Garden 5 minutes before the start of the tour.
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free

<strong>Please join us for an exclusive members-only tour of the David C. Lam Asian Garden.</strong>

Andy Hill, the garden’s Curator-Horticulturist, will take you on a 45-minute stroll through the woodland garden where he will discuss interesting plants, recent projects, and future plans.

The David C. Lam Asian Garden site is a coastal native second-growth forest under-planted with Asian trees, shrubs, woody vines, evergreen and herbaceous perennials. Many of the Asian plants are of known origin, the seeds of the plants having been collected in the wild, and several are rare species of considerable conservation value. The garden hosts significant biodiversity with the thousands of different kinds of plants that provide habitat and food for many animals, especially birds. There are several large perches suitable for large raptors, and at least one bald eagle nesting site in the garden.

The garden derives a significant microclimate from the forest cover, but also because the ocean—the Salish Sea—is 100 metres below the garden. The main path, Asian Way, circumnavigates the garden, and from it, paths named for famous plant explorers of the past wind through the planted areas. Most of the pathways are covered with wood chips, which limits accessibility to some degree, but there is also a network of paved pathways suitable for guests with accessibility and mobility challenges.

<strong>Important Notes:</strong> Tour content is geared toward an adult audience but children are welcome to attend.

<strong>Parking:</strong> Free Visitor Parking for 3 hours, provided you enter your license plate.

<strong>Members only</strong>. This tour is an exclusive membership perk. Please bring your membership card.
