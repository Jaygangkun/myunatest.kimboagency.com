<strong><small>Pictured:</small></strong> <small>James (Jim) Taylor, QC.
Chair of the UNA from 2002-07.</small>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="3/4"][vc_column_text]<strong>It is with great sadness that we mourn the passing of Jim Taylor, the founding chair of the University Neighbourhoods Association (UNA). </strong>

Jim Taylor was a great friend to the residents of the university neighbourhoods and was instrumental in the creation of the UNA.

Jim was a passionate believer in the strength of community and neighbours helping neighbours. In the early days of UBC’s residential development, Jim Taylor was an active volunteer in Hampton Place. He inspired fellow residents to work together by organizing community events and raising funds to finance self-help projects.

Jim spearheaded the creation of the University Neighbourhoods Association that was incorporated under the B.C. Society Act in 2002.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]“As the first chair of the UNA, Jim combined his legal expertise and deep sense of civic duty to ensure that the UNA functioned as an effective local governance system. The UNA now provides municipal services to over 11,000 residents, “says current UNA Chair, Richard Alexander. During Jim’s tenure on the Board of Directors and for many years afterward, Jim Taylor acted as mentor to new directors and legal advisor to the Board of Directors.

As a committed civic leader, Jim brought residents together. He organized an active multicultural program and crafted various governance options for the university town. In later years, he continued to set up community initiatives that integrated new residents into the community, brought residents closer to students and the UBC administration, and fulfilled the mandate of the UNA as the governance system in a sustainable university town.

In 2009, UBC honoured Jim by dedicating a park in Hawthorn Place in his name, and in 2012 he was awarded a Commemorative Medal during the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee for his work in the university neighbourhoods. Mike Feeley, former Chair of the UNA, eloquently summed up Jim’s contributions.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

<h2>New Car Sharing Parking Strategy</h2>
Effective October 10th, 2016 (*Extended). All one-way car sharing vehicles (Car2go and Evo) will need to park in designated “Car Share Only Parking” in Hawthorn Place, Hampton Place and Wesbrook Place.

It is important for all car share users to leave their car share vehicles in “Car Share Only Parking” locations.

To ensure UNA designated “Car Share Only Parking” locations are able to meet the on-going car share parking demand, the UNA Office has set up a <strong>Simple Two-Step Process:</strong>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h3><strong>Step 1</strong>, For <strong>UNA residents </strong>that cannot find “Car Share Only Parking” space within the neighbourhood:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>For<strong> Hawthorn</strong> or <strong>Hampton</strong> <strong>Place</strong> Residents:
<ul>
 	<li>When you are unable to find any “Car Share Only Parking” space in the neighbourhood and need to end your trip in a UBC surface parking lot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>For<strong> Wesbrook</strong> <strong>Place</strong> Residents:
<ul>
 	<li>When you need to park outside a <strong>2 block radius</strong> from your home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 2</strong>, Please email <a href="mailto:Parking@myuna.ca"><strong>Parking@myuna.ca</strong></a> with the following information:</h3>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Your UNA Access Card Number</strong></li>
 	<li>Car2Go – <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Car2Go-screenShot.png">Screenshot</a> of My Trip info; EVO – <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/EVO-Trip-Info.jpg">Screenshot</a> of My Trip info and your end of trip location.</li>
</ol>
The UNA office will actively review resident’s feedback. Designated Car Share Only Parking locations will be adjusted according to UNA resident’s demand.

It is important that all residents should respect this new change, and avoid leaving your personal vehicle inside any designated “Car Share Only Parking”. Any personal vehicles park inside “Car Share Only Parking” <strong>will be towed immediately without further notice</strong>.

Going forward, our invigilators will place special attention on any violation against “Car Share Only Parking”, “Modo” and “Zipcar” on-street parking locations.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[UNA Fire Protection Services Cost Restructuring]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong>The Province of British Columbia recently informed the UNA Board that we will now join other municipalities, including the UEL, in paying for fire protection services. </strong>

The cost for fire protection services will be:
<ul>
 	<li>$500K payable in our budget year 2016-17.</li>
 	<li>$1M payable in our budget year 2017-18.</li>
 	<li>$1M+ payable in subsequent years.</li>
</ul>
The new fee is significant, however, the Board has a clear process to manage this issue. We are confident that we will manage the impact to our residents. The UNA and UBC are collaborating through the recently-established Joint Financial Task Force. The Task Force is exploring opportunities for the UNA to raise new revenues and to save costs without reducing resident service levels.

Current tax rates for residents (the combination of rural tax rate and service levy) will not be impacted.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h2>Information for UNA Residents</h2>
Residents living in UBC neighbourhoods, unlike residents in other unincorporated areas including the University Endowment Lands, do not currently pay a fee for fire protection services. The Province of British Columbia is restructuring this financial model.

As a result, the Province has decided that UBC neighbourhood residents will fund their share of fire protection services costs. The province will phase in the restructure, starting with half of the costs (approximately $500K) in 2016/17 and full costs (approximately $1 million) in 2017/2018. Annual fire protection service costs are projected to increase by approximately 3%-4% annually. Current tax rates for residents (the combination of rural tax rate and service levy) will not be impacted.

To manage the impact, the UNA and UBC have created a Joint Financial Task Force. The Task Force will collectively identify opportunities to minimize the impact of this change on UNA services.  Key principles of managing the financial impact include ensuring the UNA’s long-term financial health; minimizing service level impacts; and sharing the financial burden between the UNA and UBC. The process will include engagement with residents ranging from the regular sharing of information through to community conversations about options being explored and recommended.

The province is expected to recover the fire protection costs by establishing a new fire protection levy as part of residents’ rural tax (a UBC resident’s property tax bill is comprised of the provincial rural tax plus the UBC Service Levy). Current tax rates for residents (the combination of rural tax rate and service levy) will not be impacted.

This initiative also provides an opportunity to discuss other important service provision issues with the provincial government, like road jurisdiction, parking and water service.

<strong> </strong>The UNA is committed to keeping the community informed through various mechanisms (The Campus Resident, e-blasts, web updates, and in-person events). Communications will include process updates, how the UNA is working with UBC to manage the financial impacts, and ongoing updates on outcomes as information becomes available.

<strong> </strong><strong>If you have any questions, please contact Jan Fialkowski, Executive Director, University Neighbourhoods Association at </strong><a href="mailto:jan.fialkowski@myuna.ca"><strong>jan.fialkowski@myuna.ca</strong></a><strong> or 604.827.5317.</strong>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
[/vc_column_text][vc_tta_accordion][vc_tta_section title="1. How are fire protection services provided at UBC?" tab_id="1478722008085-cedaf8cf-b4fb"][vc_column_text]The province contracts the City of Vancouver to provide fire protection services to UBC, the University Endowment Lands and Pacific Spirit Park. The contract’s cost for fiscal year 2016/17 is approximately $7.1 million. The province recovers a portion of this cost from UEL residents via a general ‘rural’ tax rate that is higher than that paid by UBC neighbourhood residents.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="2. Is UBC also being asked to pay for fire protection services for the academic campus?" tab_id="1478722008142-2b17da28-b6c4"][vc_column_text]Fire protection services for the academic campus are provided through a model similar to other universities, as a public good provided by municipal fire departments. The province has committed to continuing to fund UBC’s academic fire protection services costs.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="3. Why is the provincial government restructuring the financial model for UNA fire protection services at UBC? Why now?" tab_id="1478722081121-1bc3418a-646b"][vc_column_text]Residents living in UBC Neighbourhoods, unlike residents in B.C.’s other unincorporated areas, do not currently pay a separate levy for fire protection. For example, the province recovers a portion of fire protection services costs from UEL residents via a general ‘rural’ tax rate that is higher than that paid by UBC neighbourhood residents residents (e.g. in 2015, the Class 1 residential rural tax rate for UEL is 0.8682 per $1,000 assessed value and for the UNA it is 0.5700 per $1,000 assessed value).

The province has reviewed this irregularity and has decided to restructure the financial model to bring UBC neighbourhood residents in line with the fire protection services funding model used in BC’s other unincorporated communities.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="4. What are the annual fire protection services costs the UBC neighbourhood residents must take on?" tab_id="1478722116222-5684b039-e533"][vc_column_text]The Province has decided that UBC neighbourhood residents will fund their share of fire protection services costs. The province will phase in the restructure, with half of the costs (approximately $500K) starting in 2016/17 and full costs (approximately $1 million) in 2017/18. Annual fire protection services costs are projected to increase by approximately 3%-4% annually, based on the City of Vancouver’s fire protection service costs.

The share of fire protection service costs is based on the number of UBC neighbourhood residents. This is the same method the province uses calculate UEL residents’ contribution for fire protection services costs.

Residents in UBC neighbourhoods pay two types of ‘property tax’: a rural tax to the province, and a services levy to UBC. The leases between UBC and residents say that these two rates combined will equal the same tax rate for an equivalent assessed property in the City of Vancouver.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="6. What impact will this have on the UNA budget?" tab_id="1478722177196-f82b8a89-ca05"][vc_column_text]This provincial decision will reduce the services levy revenue that supports the UNA’s annual budget. For 2016/17, fire protection services costs are approximately 10% of the UNA’s proposed total operating budget. In 2017/18, fire costs are forecasted to represent approximately 20% of UNA’s budget.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="7. What is the UNA doing to address these budget challenges and minimize the impact?" tab_id="1478722208038-82a9e258-13da"][vc_column_text]To manage the impact, the UNA and UBC have created a Joint Financial Task Force. The Task Force will collectively identify opportunities to minimize the impact of this change on UNA services. Key principles of managing the financial impact include ensuring the UNA’s long-term financial health; minimizing service level impacts; and sharing the financial burden between the UNA and UBC. As this work evolves, the UNA will keep the community informed.

The restructuring of the financial model for fire protection services also provides an opportunity to discuss other service delivery issues with the province that are of importance to the UNA and UBC. In particular, the impact of provincial road ownership on UNA neighbourhood parking and road maintenance, and the extra cost for UBC to purchase water from the regional district.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="8. How are the UNA and UBC working together to find solutions?" tab_id="1478722237370-f0f50aa8-416a"][vc_column_text]The UNA and UBC are collaborating through the recently-established Joint Financial Task Force. The Task Force is exploring opportunities for the UNA to raise new revenues and to save costs without reducing resident service levels.

The Task Force includes senior UBC and UBC Properties Trust staff, UNA Board members and staff, and residents. The Task Force will be making recommendations to the UNA and UBC Boards for decision. The process will include engagement with residents ranging from the regular sharing of information through to community conversations about options being explored and recommended.

The Task Force will keep residents informed as the process proceeds over the coming months.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="9. How can residents stay informed as this process unfolds?" tab_id="1478722264357-e10f4374-82cb"][vc_column_text]The UNA is committed to communicating with the broader community through various mechanisms (The Campus Resident, e-blasts, web updates, and in-person events).

When was this decision made by the Province?" tab_id="1478722299597-7410c020-e160"][vc_column_text]The province informed the UNA Board of Directors of this decision in early 2016.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="11. Why are UNA residents only finding out about this now?" tab_id="1478722411683-259dcd94-cb93"][vc_column_text]The UNA and UBC worked with the province to understand the full scope and impact of the changes, and to clarify the financial calculations and proposed timeline. Now that those details are understood, the UNA is informing residents.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="12. Could the UNA provide our own fire protection services?" tab_id="1478722446493-7434f5a3-2a6d"][vc_column_text]It is not financially practical for the UNA to provide its own fire protection services. The province currently pays for fire protection services at UBC, the University Endowment Lands and Pacific Spirit Park via a contract with the City of Vancouver. The cost for fiscal 2016/2017 is approximately $7.1 million.

The province has committed to continuing to pay UBC’s academic fire protection costs (for 2016/17 approximately $5.7 million). The remaining costs are recovered from the UEL and the UNA. Fire protection services costs in municipalities with similar population size are significantly higher than the amount recovered from the UEL and the UNA.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_accordion][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[<font size="3" color="red">- SNOW REMOVAL ADVISORY -</font>]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The UNA continues to respond to adverse weather conditions and will increase snow and ice removal resources as required.

This winter has been uncharacteristically wintery with numerous bouts of cold overnight temperatures and snow events. With each event, UNA-contracted crews have been deployed to clear and salt sidewalks, letdowns and pathways within the neighbourhoods. UBC crews have also been dispatched to clear and salt roadways within the UNA and UBC academic realm, in addition to key campus walkways, the bus loop and approaches to the hospital

Similar to other municipalities in the Lower Mainland, the responsibility for snow removal is a balance of the local property owners and local government crews. As with other municipalities this winter, there remains significant snow and ice on side streets, and on sidewalks, if an owner has not taken the appropriate steps to clear snow and ice from the path adjacent to their property.

The UNA will continue to proactively monitor and respond to the on-going weather conditions. UNA staff would like to remind residents to stay safe and be extra careful when walking outside or driving. We also urge that building owners be extra vigilant and keep their sidewalks clear and salted/sanded.

		<title><![CDATA[Say Hello and Namaste to Andrew Clements]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>You Never Know Where Life’s Path Is Going to Take You</h2>
These words are especially true for Andrew Clements, Program Manager for Wesbrook and the Old Barn Community Centres. From rising baseball star, to yoga teacher, community centre manager, and now soon-to-be dad, Andrew’s path has taken him far and he’s learned a great deal along the way.

Growing up on Vancouver’s North Shore, his childhood was full of sports. Basketball, volleyball, football - you name it and he was on the team. But it was baseball that really peaked his interest, and after high school he was awarded a baseball scholarship to the University of San Francisco.

One international relocation and an undergraduate degree later, Andrew was working hard to build his professional baseball career. Playing for an independent professional team out of Evansville, Indiana (Go Otters!), he seemed to be unstoppable. However, his life in baseball came with a heavy price. By the time Andrew turned 26, he had undergone 4 major surgeries and was in a lot of pain. His doctor told him he should quit baseball if he wanted to be able to walk by age 40. Andrew decided his future was not worth the risk, and sat out on the bench for good.

<img class="wp-image-1367 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/P1480143-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="270" />

He came home to Vancouver to find out where life would take him next. Not quite ready to step away from baseball completely, Andrew took up an assistant coach position at UBC while studying his master’s degree in Kinesiology.

During this time, Andrew was experimenting in the world of yoga. It really opened his eyes - not only to the physical benefits but to the mental benefits as well. In the cutthroat realm of baseball, it’s all about reaching ‘peak performance’. Be the best, the fastest, the strongest; the most important thing is the end result of the game. But in yoga, you are acting without the desire for an end result. Andrew learned that you can move beyond this desire to be the best. You can define yourself and your goals any way you want because there is no ‘right’ way to live life.

Andrew left coaching behind in order to keep practicing and benefiting from yoga. Along with breath control, meditation and concentration, the most important quality Andrew learned was the practice of gratitude. Gratitude for the opportunities he’s been given and for the chance to heal his body and mind.

<img class="wp-image-1368 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/P1480129-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="376" />After his fiancée and future parenting partner persuaded him, Andrew took a yoga teacher training course in 2009. In 2013 he joined our UNA as Youth Program Coordinator and yoga teacher, and his hard work recently earned him the Program Manager position and director of our Yoga Studio.

Andrew now gets to share his experiences and knowledge with members of this wonderful community. He wants everyone reading this to know that you can practice yoga at any age, size, and ability. Andrew began in his mid-twenties, coming from a place of pain and rehabilitation, and now he is more at peace in his mind and body than ever before. Equally important, yoga is not about becoming as flexible as a pretzel. It’s about healing and growing your body and mind. Yoga is about defining your own experiences, no matter where your path has taken you. And just like Andrew’s story, once your practice begins, it can take you to some incredible places.

<img class="size-large wp-image-1369 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Yoga-Finals-0604-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" />

<h1>Car Share Parking Expansion</h1>

The UNA has been working with Modo, Zipcar, Evo, and Car2go to improve car share parking in the UBC community. The UNA has been hearing from residents that car share is an important part of our community development in Hampton Place and Wesbrook. We believe that increasing available car share parking in the entire UNA neighbourhood will not only help to increase green transportation options, but also make our community more sustainable. In light of this, we are excited to introduce four new car share parking locations:
<ul>
 	<li>Binning Road North</li>
 	<li>Binning Road</li>
 	<li>Gray Ave West</li>
 	<li>Hampton Place East</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The "Eagle Drive Car Share Only Parking" location has been relocated to Eagle Drive East. Additionally, the existing "Birney Car Share Parking" location has been expanded to better accommodate an increase in demand.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_separator color="white"][vc_gmaps link="#E-8_JTNDaWZyYW1lJTIwc3JjJTNEJTIyaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSUyRm1hcHMlMkZkJTJGZW1iZWQlM0ZtaWQlM0QxV0REMzdGQUowMUFsNzFmT3lFaDA2akgxdzk0JTI2aGwlM0RlbiUyMiUyMHdpZHRoJTNEJTIyNjQwJTIyJTIwaGVpZ2h0JTNEJTIyNDgwJTIyJTNFJTNDJTJGaWZyYW1lJTNF" title="UNA Car Share Parking Locations"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

UNA ACCESS CARD AND MEMBERSHIP</strong></p>

<strong><u>ROAD SERVICING UPDATE – Expect Disruptions this Summer</u></strong>

Issue Date: June 5, 2017

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Acadia Road Civil Works</u></strong>

Starting next week (week of June 11), construction crews will begin preparing the west side of Acadia for underground servicing and the reconstruction of the road, which will include a new sidewalk on the UBC side where one currently doesn’t exist.

<u>Major road work will take place in July and August</u>. Safety and the flow of vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians is a top priority for Musqueam Capital Corporation, and as such, a comprehensive traffic management plan will be in place. Allow extra time for certain delays and detours.

<strong><u>What you can expect in the coming months</u></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Removal of the west side curb, plantings and the “islands” with the tree stumps in them.</li>
 	<li>Portions of Toronto Road and University Boulevard will be impacted by road works.</li>
 	<li>There will be a deep trench along Acadia with shallow work to follow.</li>
 	<li>    To complete the reconstruction of Acadia between Toronto and Ortona during the school holidays, crews will also work on Saturdays from <span data-term="goog_1815122151">9:00am to 4:00pm</span>, except for the long weekend.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong><u>What is underground servicing</u></strong>

Underground servicing is the installation of the sanitary sewer system, storm water system, and water lines. This work requires deep trenches. Shallow work will follow to install power and communications lines.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Regular Communication</u></strong>

MCC will continue to regularly communicate with neighbours about activity on Block F, with an aim to answering anticipated questions and helping people plan for traffic disruptions.

		<title><![CDATA[Vancouver School Board Election]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Many UNA residents have recently received Vancouver Votes cards for the by-election to be held this month to elect 9 school trustees. This card may be confusing, in that it refers to residents of the University Endowment Lands and UEL voters, but not to UNA residents or voters. To clarify, UNA residents who are Canadian citizens and meet the other eligibility conditions may also vote in the election.

&nbsp;

Voting can be done either on <strong>October 10th</strong> (at Vancouver City Hall) or on Saturday, <strong>October 14th</strong>, from 8:00am to 8:00pm (at University Hill Secondary School). You will need to bring ID that proves you are a UNA resident. Please note that if you are not on the Voters List, you can register to vote at the voting place.

&nbsp;

There is also a by-election for one Vancouver City Councillor. UNA residents are not entitled to vote in that by-election and may only vote for school trustees.

&nbsp;

For further information, including eligibility for voting and the acceptable ID if you need to register at the voting place, see the <a href="http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2017-by-election-uel-voter-information.pdf">Vancouver Votes card</a>.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Hello, We Are Community!]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[To all members of this wonderful UBC community and beyond: We here at the University Neighbourhoods Association: Parks &amp; Recreation are undergoing an exciting transformation. A rebranding, an evolution, a make-over, if you will! We are evolving in order to better serve and connect with those not only in our community, but to everyone across Vancouver. Ultimately, we want to become a better version of who we are and build off of what we started over a decade ago.

How are we changing to make this happen, you ask? To get things started, we had to ask ourselves two very important questions, “Who are we? And who do we want to be?” because in order to create a better version of ourselves, we first have to establish our identity. If you ask anyone around the neighbourhood to describe us, you might get a vague response, something about how we operate the Old Barn Community Centre and Wesbrook Community Centre. While this is certainly true, we want to be more than a mysterious organization and certainly more than ‘Parks &amp; Recreation’. That being said, please bid farewell to ‘UNA: Parks &amp; Recreation’ and say hello to ‘We are Community’! Along with our new name, we have re-designed our visual look and logo, and we are launching a new website, <a href="http://www.wearecommunityvan.ca">www.wearecommunityvan.ca</a>, to be more efficient and accessible!

You may be wondering why we have decided to revamp and re-style. Our new branding is actually only the first step in our transformation. It will be the foundation upon which we will enhance and grow. We have high hopes and big dreams for our ‘new’ Community. We aim to be a <em>centre for excellence</em>, and we will be bold and innovative. We will provide services and facilities that are just as vibrant and unique as the community that we have the pleasure of serving.

You can create, socialize, play, and engage with us, because we want to be the third pillar in your lives. There’s<em> Home</em>, there’s <em>Work</em>, and with us, there’s <em>Community</em>. But we want to go even further than the surrounding UBC area. We want the whole world – all right, at least all of Vancouver, to know that we are here and that we are an inclusive community for <em>everyone.</em> “We are Community” is not simply ‘we’ at Wesbrook Village, or even ‘we’ at all of UBC. It means you at Hawthorn Place, your friend who lives in East Vancouver, your friend’s Grandma living in Burnaby, and even your friend’s Grandma’s dog named Peaches. Here at the UNA, we want to connect with you and connect you with others in order to truly create a welcoming and dynamic community.

You may now be thinking about what you can expect from us from this point forward. We here at the University Neighbourhoods Association: We are Community can tell you with pride that you can expect an inclusive, engaging, and vibrant UNA. From programs for toddlers all the way to seniors; from ESL courses to yoga to cartooning lessons; you can expect a truly special place to work, play, and live. You can expect a <em>centre for excellence</em>, for you, and for everyone. So come and introduce, or reintroduce yourselves to us, and let’s make this community even more amazing.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Why is UBC is the Best Place to Be This Summer?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong>Happy August, everyone!</strong>

&nbsp;

You might not think of UBC as the best place to spend your summer days. After all, it is a university campus! You imagine boring libraries, silent study halls, and zombies- I mean students, wandering around campus not knowing what to do with all their free time. But actually, UBC is more than just a school and it is way cooler than you think. It’s a major community, growing bigger every day, and that means there’s lots to do. What’s even better, everything is way less busy than in Metro Vancouver! That means summer fun without all the crowds and all the waiting. Here are my top 9 reasons why UBC is the best place to be this summer. Read on to discover your next summer adventure!

&nbsp;

<strong>9. Pacific Spirit Regional Park</strong>

Calling Pacific Spirit Park beautiful would be a grave understatement. Personally, I like to use the term “heaven” for this place. The park boasts 73 kilometres of walking and hiking trails, for people, dogs, bikes, and even horses! The trails are perfect for an easy and tranquil walk in the forest. I like to run in the park 2 or 3 times a week because of the fresh air, the peaceful environment, and the fact that I get to pass by SO MANY dogs! Seriously, the prospect of seeing the next cute pup keeps me going.

<strong><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-905" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pacific-spirit-regional-park-1024x323.jpg" alt="pacific-spirit-regional-park" width="1024" height="323" /></strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>8. All the Dogs!</strong>

Yeah, I like dogs. Who doesn’t? But I think UBC is a hotspot for dog lovers, because there are pooches everywhere. With the high number of parks at UBC, it’s simply the perfect place to raise little ol’ Peaches. And that’s great for me, err, I mean everyone, because the people are nice and always let you play with their dogs. As a result, I have met some fascinating people and heard some great stories - simply by meeting their furry friends!

<strong><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-907" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/poochies-1024x427.jpg" alt="poochies" width="1024" height="427" /></strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>7. You'll Meet Great People</strong>

Speaking of the people, did I mention how great they are? Just in the past few weeks, I’ve met some fascinating individuals. I talked with a man for an hour who had just arrived in Vancouver that morning from Tanzania. He had spent the previous week climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (he made it to the top!). I also ran into a local Vancouver comedian who was outside helping his daughters catch Pokémon. How cute is that? The friendliness and openness of people in this community is a refreshing change from the typical business-as-usual feel of Metro Vancouver.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-658" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/blog-welcome-to-community.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/blog-welcome-to-community.jpg 900w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/blog-welcome-to-community-300x200.jpg 300w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/blog-welcome-to-community-768x512.jpg 768w" alt="blog-welcome-to-community" width="800" height="533" />

&nbsp;

<strong>6. Catching all those Pokémon</strong>

But it’s not just the people… it’s the Pokémon, too! There is an impressive amount of those weird little pocket monsters to catch at UBC. I've seen groups of people of all ages, wandering around with their phones, questing to be the best there ever was. So, playing Pokémon Go around UBC will not only help you catch them all, you’ll be going for a long and beautiful walk around campus!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-884" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/7.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/7.jpg 980w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/7-300x150.jpg 300w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/7-768x384.jpg 768w" alt="7" width="800" height="400" />

&nbsp;

<strong>5. The Amazing Views</strong>

Don’t look at your phone for too long, though, because you’ll miss the views of this beautiful place. The campus itself has gorgeous state-of-the-art architecture, scenic views of the islands and mountains beyond the inlet, and tons of green space. Want to have a picnic, toss the Frisbee around, or just soak up the sun on your favourite blanket? You can do it all here. Even better, our very own Wesbrook Community Centre is right next to Pacific Spirit Park, and the Old Barn Community Centre is just steps from UBC’s Botanical Gardens, several wonderful museums, and world-famous Wreck Beach. So no matter where you find yourself in this community, you will be surrounded by beauty.

&nbsp;

<strong><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-915" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Wild-1024x373.jpg" alt="Wild" width="1024" height="373" /></strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>4. Wreck Beach</strong>

Speaking of beauty, Wreck Beach’s attractiveness deserves its own entire article. North America’s largest clothing-optional beach is without-a-doubt the strangest, most beautiful spot in Vancouver. You can play nude bocce ball with beach locals, take a picturesque walk along the 7km shore, and tan those pasty buns – you’re blinding everyone!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-886" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/5.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/5.jpg 984w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/5-300x152.jpg 300w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/5-768x390.jpg 768w" alt="5" width="800" height="407" />

&nbsp;

<strong>3. The Splash Pad at Wesbrook Community Centre</strong>

And if you get a little too warm at Wreck Beach, you can cool off at Wesbrook Community Centre’s new Splash Pad. It’s a family and pet-friendly water park that is the perfect complement to your summer fun. Open every day this summer from 8 am to 8 pm, it’s designed to turn on only when you press the activation button. A happy summer is a water-saving summer.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-887" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/4.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/4.jpg 600w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/4-300x200.jpg 300w" alt="4" width="800" height="533" />

&nbsp;

<strong>2. We Are Community Programs</strong>

A happy summer is also one where you have fun and try new things. Wesbrook Community Centre and the Old Barn Community Centre offer hundreds of programs to help you stay active, healthy, and busy this summer. You can check out all we have to offer at <a href="http://www.wearecommunityvan.ca/">www.wearecommunityvan.ca</a>. This summer, I wanted to try something new so I’ve been attending our newest DDP Power Yoga class. Is it possible to feel simultaneously almost dead and more alive than ever? Who knew that getting my butt kicked twice a week would be my favourite summertime activity...

<img class="alignnone wp-image-829" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/yoga-hatha.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/yoga-hatha.jpg 900w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/yoga-hatha-300x267.jpg 300w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/yoga-hatha-768x683.jpg 768w" alt="yoga-hatha" width="800" height="711" />

&nbsp;

<strong>1. We Are Community Events</strong>

And finally, when you’re not busy with ballet, guitar lessons, or volleyball drop-ins this summer, take advantage of one of our awesome (and free!) community events. On Friday, August 12<sup>th</sup>, we’re hosting our second “Evening in the Park”, an outdoor live concert featuring Buckman Coe! And join us on Saturday, August 20<sup>th</sup> for the Old Barn Community Centre’s 10<sup>th</sup> birthday celebration. The Barn Raising will be a fantastic event with live music, a petting zoo, free BBQ, a pie eating contest, and so much more. Oh, and I’ll be there too, along with all of our amazing staff – what more could you want?

<img class="alignnone wp-image-888" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1141.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1141.jpg 640w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_1141-300x199.jpg 300w" alt="DSC_1141" width="800" height="531" />

&nbsp;

<strong>This Summer At UBC, You Will Never Be Bored!</strong>

With everything I’ve just mentioned, spending your summer days around UBC means you’re going to have a great time and you’ll never be bored. Just picture yourself, on a beautiful sunny day, at UBC: you start with a 9 am Hatha Yoga class at Wesbrook Community Centre, followed by a leisurely stroll through Pacific Spirit Park (where you meet delightful people and the cutest dogs ever). Next you make your way over to Wreck Beach, catching Pokemon along the way, and you have a beautiful ocean-side picnic. You feel relaxed, rejuvenated, and ready for more! The opportunities and activities are endless. That is why UBC really is the best place to be this summer.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-889" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" srcset="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg 800w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-300x171.jpg 300w, http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-768x438.jpg 768w" alt="1" width="800" height="456" />

		<title><![CDATA[The Best Barn Raising Ever + More to Come!]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>The 10th Annual Barn Raising was a smashing success!</strong>

&nbsp;

Thank you for celebrating the Old Barn Community Centre's 10th birthday with us! I hope you had as much fun as we did. At least 600 party-goers showed up: members of the community and beyond, from babies to seniors, from dogs to men in hot dog costumes! The music from Rob Hill Band was great, the artists blew everyone away in the art battle, and the weather was absolutely beautiful.

&nbsp;

"<em>What a party!</em>", said a local man as he walked past me with a hot dog drowning in ketchup.

&nbsp;

<strong>What a party, indeed! Here are some of the best highlights from the best Barn Raising yet:</strong>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Nils, one of our longtime (and dare I say handsomest) volunteers was dressed up in a full hot dog costume while, you guessed it, grilling and serving hot dogs. He gets bonus points for total dedication to the role and making everyone smile.

&nbsp;

<img class="wp-image-1008 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-26-597x1024.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-26" width="275" height="471" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

During the youth pie eating contest, a little boy named Anthony simply refused to eat his pie. His reason? "I just don't want to". When host Andrew asked him if he'd like a To-Go box, he simply refused again. Who wouldn't want to take a free pie home? Poor Anthony was disqualified. It's okay, Anthony, I'll eat that pie for you.

&nbsp;

<img class="wp-image-1003 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-64-1024x619.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-64" width="710" height="429" />

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">It was clear that the miniature horse named Princess was stealing everyone's hearts with her cuteness. In related news, no one has heard from Vanessa, Front Desk Receptionist, or Princess since Saturday. It is believed that they rode off into the sunset together.</p>
<img class=" wp-image-1006 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14047159_10209137892177411_8017978240252470015_o-576x1024.jpg" alt="14047159_10209137892177411_8017978240252470015_o" width="405" height="720" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A local woman and lover of animals told me that it was endearing and a little bit hilarious to see the community children interact with farm animals for the first time. Some kids didn't even know how what to do around them! I suppose that's what happens when kids are around books and academics instead of barns and animals!

&nbsp;

<img class="wp-image-1009 alignnone" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-38-1024x743.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-38" width="795" height="577" />

&nbsp;

Everyone loved the barn photo booth and it turned out to be fantastically silly, especially when Luna the Cow showed up. What's a good Barn Raising without Luna?

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1002" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-3-683x1024.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-3" width="270" height="404" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-1004" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-78-740x1024.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-78" width="292" height="404" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-1007" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-25-658x1024.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-25" width="260" height="405" />

&nbsp;

Lastly, my favorite highlight of the whole party was actually at the end, when volunteers, staff, and children from the community all came together for an amazing photo. It truly shows how everyone can work, play, and celebrate all together.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1005" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Old-Barn-Photos-83-1024x527.jpg" alt="Old Barn Photos-83" width="824" height="424" />

&nbsp;

Everyone's contributions at this year's barn raising are so appreciated. Thank you to: all the volunteers, staff, and sponsors for your time and support; Dan for taking some great photos of the event; Andrew for being a great host and MC; and two extra big thank yous to Taylor and Valenda for putting so much time and effort into planning and organizing this celebration.

&nbsp;

		<title><![CDATA[Meet Molly: Director of Security, Ferocious Feline]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Last Friday, it was National Dog Day here in Canada. I'm sure you all know by now that I love dogs. They're happy, loving, and playful - what more could you ask for in man's best friend? Well, I thought about writing a post all about dogs, but since I've talked about them so much already, I suspect that there might be some feline jealousy lurking on the warm tops of fridges and inside cardboard boxes across the city. That is why I am dedicating this post to cats, and I present you with an interview I conducted on Friday with one of our staff members, Molly.

&nbsp;

<em>August 26, 2016: I catch up with Molly at Wesbrook Community Centre. Her very presence dominates the room. She looks almost regal, and her gaze can pierce the hearts of a thousand warriors.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Krysta</em>: Hi, Molly. Thank you for joining me today. Nice to see you. Your fur is looking quite nice, this time of year.

<em>Molly</em>: <strong>*Meows*</strong>

<em>K</em>: Yes, I <em>can</em> tell that you've just been brushed. So, as Director of Security, what exactly do you do here?

<em>M</em>: <strong>*Stares off at the wall, meows*</strong>

<em>K</em>: You oversee your kingdom....? So you make sure that everyone is safe and secure! How noble of you. We appreciate your protection-- yes, you have very powerful claws, thank you for demonstrating their sharpness on my foot.

<em>M</em>: <strong>*Stares blankly*</strong>

<em>K</em>: So, Molly. I have your old resume here and it says that in your free time, you like to watch TV, listen to blues music, and constantly put your pet mouse in human shoes. Am I missing anything?

<em>M</em>: <strong>*Purrs*</strong>

<em>K</em>: You like to sleep a lot! Of course. How about at work? How do you keep yourself busy on the job?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<em>K</em>: You like to sleep on the middle of the carpet where everyone can trip over you? And then you attack their legs? Well, I can't say that I'm surprised - you must be on edge all day from the stress of your position.

<em>M</em>: <strong>*Yawns*</strong>

<em>K</em>: Interesting... Well, Molly, I have just a few more questions for you today, and then I'll let you get back to your rotisserie chicken and catnap. What are your thoughts on National Dog Day in Canada? Do you have many dog friends?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<em>K</em>: ..... I guess that's all the time we have!

&nbsp;

<hr />

&nbsp;

Molly had to leave in order to... get some more work done. But she wanted me wish our readers a happy National Dog Day!

		<title><![CDATA[Fall In Love With Yoga This Season]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[It feels like a new year and a fresh start in our community. School is back in session, the changing season has begun with her true autumn colours, and the first week of programs has officially started at We Are Community. If it wasn’t for the sunshine, the crispness of September air, and the fresh faces of students who are still getting enough sleep every night, we might actually feel a little worn out by all the bustling activity!

This vibrant and hopeful feeling among our neighbourhoods is not without good reason. In July we had the pleasure of introducing you to our new brand, as well as unique programs and new ways of connecting with you and other members of the community. Our new website, w<em>earecommunityvan.ca</em>, along with our growing social media presence, is making community engagement easier and more accessible than ever.

Here at We Are Community, we love yoga, and we want you to love it too. The practice of yoga can be a rewarding physical, mental, and spiritual journey. Yoga can be your weekly amazing workout. It can be your daily de-stressor at the end of a busy day and offer you a deep connection to your body that may change your life. There are so many wonderful benefits associated with the practice of yoga that we feel like shouting them from rooftops! Luckily we have access to more sane methods of communication. So as part of our ongoing quest to offer accessible and exciting programming, we decided to completely transform our yoga model at The Studio.

<strong>Yoga at The Studio</strong> now welcomes you to 14 different styles of yoga, with 22 classes per week. Our new pricing structure ensures that your mind as well as your wallet will remain at ease during your practice. We offer a one time drop-in fee for all yoga classes, monthly and yearly memberships, and a 10- and 20-class pass. Not sure which membership is right for you? Try a first-timer 1-month unlimited yoga membership for just $49.

No matter your age, yoga level, or schedule, we have a class that will make you fall in love with the wonderful world of yoga. Find out more by visiting Wesbrook and The Old Barn Community Centres, or online at <em>wearecommunityvan.ca</em>. We look forward to meeting and practicing yoga with you! Namaste.

		<title><![CDATA[How To Cure The End of Summer Blues]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<em>September 22, 2016</em>

<em>By Krysta Wallbank</em>

<hr />

Well, folks, it's that time of year again. The air outside is getting colder, the sunny days are slowly being taken over by rain, and the days themselves are becoming shorter. Autumn has officially begun and so have the end of summer blues.

If you are a student, you know that this means school has started and is now in full swing. Gone are the days of staying up late to watch 4 seasons of Friends back-to-back. Sure, you may have worked all summer to save up for your outrageously high tuition fees, but at least your job doesn't give you assigned readings and essays to write. Sadly, going out to party has been replaced with going out to study with your study group, because midterms are already just around the corner. Sleep deprived nights and caffeinated, wild looking eyes will soon be your reality. It is a somber time for all students.

And if you're not a student.... yikes, I'm sorry. Your summer is exactly the same as your autumn, and your winter, and your spring. You don't get 4 months off, unless you're a school teacher (and in that case I'm sorry for various other reasons). But you probably had <em>some</em> fun this summer, right?

&nbsp;

<img class="size-full wp-image-1094 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/8551937456_9f2c1544d3_n.jpg" alt="8551937456_9f2c1544d3_n" width="320" height="240" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pictured: people having fun.</em></p>
&nbsp;

Right. Well luckily I am here to tell you how you canturn that frown upside down, and overcome this case of the end of summer blues.

&nbsp;

<strong>STEP 1.</strong>

<hr />

Buy a box of tissues. Or several.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1092 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CryBabyTissues.png" alt="crybabytissues" width="225" height="218" />

&nbsp;

Summer is over, and that makes you sad. Cry it out. Just get it all out of your system now. Trust me, you will feel better after.

&nbsp;

<strong>STEP 2.</strong>

<hr />

Dig out your umbrella from the closet. You're going to need it. But really, you're accustomed to the rain by now! It's just a <del>lot of</del> little water... You can save time in the mornings by skipping out on styling your hair, because you know that it will just be ruined by the rain and wind anyway!

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-1095 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flippedumbrella.jpg" alt="flippedumbrella" width="506" height="340" /><em>Consider buying a second umbrella as a back-up.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Okay, it's not <em>all </em>bad. Once you've cried it out and prepared for the rain, you can get to the good stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEP 3.</strong></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Start wearing your warm and cozy sweaters! One of the best parts of autumn is the layering up of sweaters and socks and scarves. I don't know about you, but I would <em>much </em>rather be cold and able to put on another layer than be melting in the heat without being able to take off any more clothing. Autumn - 1, Summer - 0.</p>


[caption id="attachment_1096" align="aligncenter" width="392"]<img class=" wp-image-1096" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cozyweather.jpg" alt="Girl (8-10) on couch covering face with purple sweater, portrait" width="392" height="319" /> <em>Get lost in the warmth and coziness of your sweaters. Wrap  yourself forever in blankets. Become one with the couch.</em>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEP 4.</strong></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Think about Thanksgiving. Get yourself mentally prepared. Make sure your stretchy pants are ready, because you <strong>know</strong> you're going to go back for seconds. Maybe thirds. Plus dessert.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1098 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AutumnFood.jpg" alt="autumnfood" width="616" height="308" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if you do not participate in Thanksgiving celebrations, rejoice in knowing that winter food and drinks are ready for you. The pumpkin-flavoured everything, the hot chocolate, the soups, the stews, the oven-baked goods... Sorry, I'm drooling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEP 5.</strong></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Step on some crunchy leaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-1097 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crunchyleaves.jpg" alt="crunchyleaves" width="576" height="395" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Oh yeah, baby.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You read that right. The leaves are changing colour and that means they are starting to fall to the ground. Is there any sound more satisfying than stepping on a dead, crunchy leaf? I'll give you a thousand dollars if you can find a better sound. And here's a proven fact: if you are stressed out, the best therapy is to run around and crunch on some massive piles of leaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>S</strong><strong>TEP 6.</strong></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep doing some of the things you started to do this summer! Did you start working out more to get a chiseled beach body? Did you start painting? Or going out for weekly underwater-basket-weaving-wine-pairing nights? Then keep it up! Not only will it make you feel like your summer is still going, you will keep having fun, stay fit, or keep stress levels down this season. Plus, if you keep it up with your workouts, you won't feel as guilty for eating literally everything you can at Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-1100 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/basketweaving-1024x576.jpg" alt="basketweaving" width="544" height="306" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pictured: the least difficult and time-consuming hobby ever.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did you try absolutely <em>nothing</em> new this past summer? While I highly doubt that, it's never too late to get out there and try new things. Click <a href="http://www.wearecommunityvan.ca">here</a> to check out all the programs you can try this season.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEP 7.</strong></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Get excited for Halloween! It is creeping up on us quickly. Stock up on toothbrushes and floss for the inevitable cavity-causing candy you will consume. Carve some pumpkins, decorate your home, and plan your Halloween party!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, and don't forget to buy some orange spray paint and an over-priced suit so you can dress up as Donald Trump. Because let's be honest, making fun of that character this Halloween will be the highlight of this season.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-1101 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trumpz.jpg" alt="trumpz" width="451" height="451" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Perfect.</em></p>
&nbsp;

And here's a pro-tip: If you're planning on handing out goodies at your home, and you actually hand out granola bars or gum, you can truly say you were a monster for Halloween.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[10 Awesome Events To Check Out This October]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[October is one of my favourite months of the year. Is there anything bad about this month? The beautiful colours of autumn, the family gatherings of Thanksgiving (which include guilt-free food indulgence), and the excitement of Halloween all fall within 31 glorious days. The only bad thing that happens during October is midterm week, but I'm willing to accept that in exchange for at least 5 pumpkin pies - one for each soul-crushing exam. Non-students, you can have 5 pies anyway, just for being so dang good-looking.

But wait, it gets better! October is more full of goodness than you thought.

&nbsp;

		<title><![CDATA[Lessons I Learnt from Halloween at Wesbrook Community Centre]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[Halloween is over, friends. If you're anything like me, your pants are a little tighter and you've sworn off candy for at least a month (but let's be honest with ourselves - we'll only last a few more days).

The infamous October 31st was a huge success, and not just because it was one of 3 days of the month that didn't see rain. Halloween at Wesbrook Community Centre was possibly the best event we've ever hosted. From 4-7 PM, the centre was transformed into a scary-sweet wonderland. We had tons of games in the Gymnasium, crafts and pumpkin decorating in the Art Room, and a spooky haunted house in the Youth &amp; Senior Centre.

&nbsp;

<img class=" wp-image-1144 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Header.jpg" alt="header" width="489" height="368" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pictured: Tough Hombre, Kitty Cat, Nerd, Snail, and Rick James</em></p>
The turnout was incredible. We were visited by vampires, space aliens, ninjas, and everything else imaginable. I thought our event would be pretty standard, but was I ever wrong. Here are a few things I learned about Halloween, lessons that I certainly won't forget for next year!

&nbsp;

<strong>Kids LOVE Candy. Really. I'm Scared.</strong>

<hr />

I know it's obvious that kids love candy. And sure, adults love candy too. I, personally, love candy more than anyone in the world - or so I thought. No doubt there were tons of little ones screaming and yelling "TRICK OR TREAT!" at every adult whom they thought might have the slightest chance of having candy to give away. This is completely normal (right?). But on Monday, I witnessed something that changed my life.

On this fateful day, I witnessed pure and innocent <em>hope</em> twinkling in the eyes of these sugar-craving monsters. This hope led children to yell, to plead, and ultimately to exhibit a rare silence while they waited for that magical drop of candy into their bags. Their hopeful gaze dug into the very fabric of my soul. It was powerful. The force of their beaming and hungry eyes overcame me, and I ended up giving each group of kids all the candy I had. Constantly going back to the stockpile for more, I'm pretty sure I single-handedly caused us to run out of candy in the first hour. I cannot even imagine a force as powerful as what these kids have. Think about what children can do with such vigorous hope. They could achieve world peace, end world hunger....

Or, just get their tiny hands on all the candy they could ever want. It's a good thing Halloween comes only once a year.

<strong><img class="wp-image-1145 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/222.jpg" alt="222" width="523" height="393" /></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These kids are waiting so patiently for your candy.</em></p>
&nbsp;

<strong>Kids Take Their Costumes VERY Seriously. </strong>

<hr />

Here's how I thought costumes worked: Kids will pick whatever is most popular at the time, like Frozen princesses and Spiderman. Simple, cute, and straightforward. Well, I learned that kids are more creative than I thought, and I will get <em>schooled</em> if I pretend to already know what their costume is.

&nbsp;

This one little girl, about 7 years old, was wearing a dress that I understood to be a princess dress. Standard, right? Wrong! I was chatting with this little princess and I thought she was Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. This girl couldn't hide her excitement at telling me what she was. She <em>was</em> a princess, but one that she had completely made-up. <em>That's cute</em>, I thought. Little did I know, this girl had created an entire back story for her princess. Here's a few details I remember: she is a Chinese princess, and very powerful. She lives in China but she gets to travel wherever she wants because she's royalty, obviously. And she <em>really</em> loves candy. Hint. Hint.

Dang, these kids are <em>good.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How awesome are these costumes?</em></p>
&nbsp;

<strong>Bright Colours + Wig = Disney Princess Treatment.</strong>

<hr />

I went all-out for Halloween this year. Usually I don't dress up at all, but this year was special because I was able to take part in We Are Community's Halloween festivities for the first time. To honour the memory of the beloved actor, Gene Wilder, I decided to go as Wonka candy. Bright dress, bright make-up, candy accessories all over, and a big pink wig. Most people who know me couldn't recognize me at first - I'd call that a success!

But I soon learned that my costume was like a magnet. Throughout the 3 hours of the event, I was almost constantly surrounded by kids fascinated by my costume. Parents lined up to take photos of me with their kids. Everywhere I looked someone was taking photos or videos of me. I totally felt like a Disney princess at Disneyland. It was really fun, but I think all the attention I was getting went to my head... At one point I bribed a child with candy just so he would take a photo with me. But he was really shy and his mom wanted a photo too, okay!?

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For 3 hours, I was a <strong>star</strong>!</em></p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, it was such a great Halloween that I now wish we had more than one each year. But then again, with all the candy consumption, I'm not sure if I could keep up with buying new clothes to match my ever-growing waistline...</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Explore Colour With Artist Julien Leger]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[“I just have so much in my head to produce, and I need to get it out there”, proclaims Julien Léger, architect, painter, and lover of colours. I had the pleasure of sitting down with this multi-talented man last week to talk about his work and life as an artist.

Julien grew up in France, where his artistic spark was ignited by his grandfather. Once an architect and painter himself, his grandfather taught at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris in the 1930s and 40s. He tutored his grandson in the world of art, teaching him the language of colour, nuance, and artistic exploration. Julien sold his first painting by the time he was 8 years old.

Deciding to pursue architecture as a career, Julien moved to Canada in 1997 where he studied Landscape Architecture and Architecture at the University of Montreal. Gratefully being supported by his parents in his studies, he created the Anonymous Painters group with other students. They held weekly <em>Afternoon of Art </em>gatherings, displaying their paintings and discussing the world of art. In just four years, the group had created over 300 pieces. Julien’s passion for painting only grew from there.

After moving to the West Coast and starting a family with his wife, Julien declares that he has been the most artistically productive in Vancouver. In 2008, his wife gifted him with a 1.2 km roll of painter’s canvas and just this year, he completed his first full kilometre. “But it’s not about being as productive as possible”, he explains, “it’s about always finding new ways to express myself and reveal what is really inside”.

<img class="wp-image-1257 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/galactica-in-the-afternoon.png" alt="galactica-in-the-afternoon" width="417" height="417" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>On display: 'Galactica in the Afternoon' by Julien Léger</em></p>
Julien describes himself as a “happy artist”. With his impressionistic style, he aims to evoke out-of-the-ordinary emotions in those who view his works. Utilizing mainly primary colours, the artist can reveal a broad spectrum to show the viewer just how much is possible by starting out with 3 colours. The artist, like mankind, can create complex and beautiful things using very little to begin with.

These days, Julien works on his paintings as much as he can while raising a family and working as an architect at Francl Architecture. In fact, Julien was the architect who designed our very own Wesbrook Community Centre. He is so happy with how the centre turned out, he says that he wouldn’t change a thing about it. I think the community would have to agree – it is an incredible space.

If you would like to be inspired by Julien’s work, some of his pieces are currently being displayed in Wesbrook Community Centre now until the end of January. They are for sale as well! A portion of the proceeds will go towards wonderful initiatives in our community and you will be supporting the work of a local artist. So I invite you all to take a tranquil walk through the centre, explore a world of colour, and find out what kinds of emotions Julien’s paintings will reveal within you.

		<title><![CDATA[Hello New Year, Goodbye New Year's Resolution!]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to 2017 and <em><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></em></h2>
&nbsp;

I hope you had a lovely holiday season, bringing you happily and peacefully into the New Year.

Now that it's January, you should be all settled in to your routine. Hopefully, this routine includes your pants still fitting.

&nbsp;

<img class=" wp-image-1300 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tightpantsholidayeating.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="296" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I don't deserve to wear 'skinny' jeans anymore.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[dt_gap height="20" /]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We all know that a new year means new goals and resolutions. The most common one being, of course, health-related. You want to lose weight, or workout more often, or you just want to <em>feel better.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most of us will make an ambitious resolution on January 1st. We start off strong and feel great for two days. And then the cravings, the fatigue, or the irritation at a lack of results set in. Most of us will give up by February because our goals are just impossibly unattainable. Well of course they're impossible! We can't simply make a drastic change in January and then expect to maintain it all year-long. Because real, powerful, and transformative change takes time and a little bit of effort.[dt_gap height="20" /]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-1302 aligncenter" src="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/newyearsresolution.png" alt="" width="470" height="350" />[dt_gap height="20" /]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that in mind, the most important thing I can tell you right now, while the new year is fresh in your mind, is this: do not make a New Year's Resolution. That's right. [dt_divider style="thin" /] [dt_gap height="10" /]</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Do NOT Make a New Year's Resolution!</h2>
Here's what you need to do instead: make a weekly resolution. Mark it in your calendar, set an alarm on your phone every day, or write it on your face. Small resolutions are much easier to accomplish and you will feel like you are making real changes (because you are!)

So, how do you do put this plan into action? It's easy. Allow me to use my health-related example: you want to lose weight, or workout more often, or you just want to <em>feel better. </em>I'll tell you right now that you can do all three of those things easily at our community centres through one of our many Yoga classes. All it takes is making a goal to attend 1 or 2 Yoga classes per week. All you have to do is make it your weekly resolution.

I can tell you from my own personal experience that Yoga is changing and improving my life. I have a very busy schedule, but I committed to 2 Power Yoga classes per week at our Yoga Studio last Summer, and today I can proudly say I am still accomplishing that goal every week. I'm getting my workouts, getting stronger and fitter, and I absolutely feel better.[dt_gap height="20" /]

[dt_divider style="thin" /]
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Just Try It Out!</h2>
I know that Yoga isn't for everyone, but our classes are not like those you'll find at any other Vancouver Yoga studio. Our classes are small, allowing for one-on-one instructor attention and relationship building. We have students of all levels, not just hardcore yogis who tend to intimidate beginners like myself. Best of all, we have a beautiful and serene studio overlooking Wesbrook Village.

If you have been thinking of trying yoga for the first time or getting back into your practice, I invite you to make it your weekly resolution to join us for a class. We have a yoga membership for every type of weekly resolution-setter. Unlimited monthly, 10-class pass, 20-class pass, yearly, and drop-in options are available to you. We'll even give you a one month unlimited yoga membership for $49 if it's your first time.

You can find information on instructors and scheduling here: <a href="http://wearecommunityvan.ca/yoga-at-the-studio/">http://wearecommunityvan.ca/yoga-at-the-studio/</a> , and here's a handy little schedule for your weekly resolution.

<h3>Once again, Happy New Year and I'll see you all around the Community!</h3>

		<title><![CDATA[Bringing West Coast Beauty to Wesbrook Community Centre]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Have you ever stopped to look up at a big fir tree, and wondered how its beauty took your breath away?</h2>
Have you ever looked out at the sky or the ocean, and counted how many different shades of blue there are? These are some of the questions that occupy the mind and soul of Barbara San Severino, local Vancouver artist and lover of nature.

Having lived most of her life in Vancouver, Barb tells me that she has always been drawn to nature. Whether it’s hiking, biking, boating, or skiing, being outside on the West Coast is where she feels most at home. Her passion for nature began specifically with trees, and she couldn’t bring herself to pass one by without stopping to admire it. These gentle giants offer vast amounts of colours and textures, radiating an energy that she finds simply incredible.[dt_gap height="10" /]
<h2><img class=" wp-image-1539 aligncenter" src="https://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_0226-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="566" />[dt_gap height="20" /]</h2>
<h2>Naturally, Barb was drawn to representing the trees that she so admires.</h2>
She began painting over 12 years ago. She completed several works showing trees as if you are looking up at them. In 2015, Barb displayed them in her first art show entitled Look Up. The exhibit sent a message to viewers that we should look up from our electronic devices once in a while and appreciate the natural beauty that is all around us.

No longer just looking up at trees, Barb is now also looking out at water and the ocean. Her passion has been taking her to the serene West Coast shorelines of southern British Columbia, where she finds beauty in waves meeting land to create a shoreline, or the ways in which the sky meets the ocean to create an endless horizon. The artist is currently working on an exciting new piece that includes Vancouver’s beloved Stanley Park and its surrounding waters.

Barb considers her artistic ability as a gift, and she is always trying to learn and improve. She strives to portray on a canvas the natural world that she sees. Her artistic inspiration is “raw, West Coast nature”, and this is exactly what you will see in Barb’s paintings. When I look at her work, I can feel the joy and wonder that this artist must feel when she is looking at our West Coast beauty. It makes me feel like she is bringing these places inside to share with me, like I am already there.[dt_gap height="10" /]
<h2><img class=" wp-image-1540 aligncenter" src="https://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_20150725_184204-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="566" />[dt_gap height="20" /]</h2>
<h2>If you’d like to see Barb’s artwork, many of her pieces are now on display at Wesbrook Community Centre.</h2>
I highly recommend checking them out! And on Saturday, March 25<sup>th</sup> from 2-4pm, Barb will be at the centre to showcase and discuss her work with the public. Coffee, tea, and snacks will be provided. Everyone is welcome!

		<title><![CDATA[On Sports and Recreation in the Community, a Message from Gilles Lepine]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Meet Gilles Lepine, one of our community’s newest UNA residents and UBC’s Senior Director of Athletics.</h2>
Hailing from Quebec City, this friendly French-Canadian was approached by UBC last year and was given the opportunity to work with their outstanding athletics department. On making the tough decision to move across the country, Gilles simply said, “why not?”

Gilles and his wife, Danielle, moved out of their home of 25 years and settled into Wesbrook Place last July. They were a little nervous at first, thinking about downsizing their home and being immersed in a new, West Coast lifestyle. But Gilles explains that they discovered something incredible in this community. “There are so many benefits to living here. We are surrounded by so many kind people, people who are here to learn, work, and raise their families. There are lots of people but it still feels like a small village. Everything is close by and convenient - I feel like I’m living in the future!”

Gilles is already taking full advantage of what our futuristic community has to offer. Besides exploring the natural beauty of Pacific Spirit Park and riding around campus on his bicycle, he enjoys working out and doing yoga with Danielle at Wesbrook Community Centre.[dt_gap height="10" /]

<img class="size-large wp-image-1731 aligncenter" src="https://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GillesDanielle-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gilles and Danielle outside of Wesbrook Community Centre</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>[dt_gap height="10" /]</em></p>

<h2>As a lifelong sports enthusiast who made a career out of his passion,</h2>
he claims that sports and recreation are simply part of his DNA. This makes Gilles the perfect person to work as UBC’s Senior Director of Athletics; he knows how important recreation is in order to live a full and happy life. As a new UNA resident, he hopes to share this message with everyone in our community. He knows that there is something for everyone to enjoy through UBC Athletics, even if you are not a varsity athlete. Going to a basketball game is a great way to spend a Friday night, but it’s also great way of meeting new people and building connections with other members of the community.

Gilles explains that children benefit the most from going to games and cheering on their team. When they see these incredible athletes working together, they see role models. They see young, hard-working people who are not only training hard and staying active, but who are also studying and working towards a degree. If children want to be like their favourite players, they’ll learn that they need to work hard and get an education, too. There is no better place to do these things than right here at UBC![dt_gap height="10" /]

<p style="text-align: center;">[dt_gap height="10" /]</p>

<h2>The UNA and UBC have a strong relationship, but Gilles hopes to strengthen the bond between the community and UBC’s Athletics.</h2>
He wants UNA residents to learn about all the sports and recreation that are available. Most importantly, he wants people to feel excited and interested in getting involved. That is why he will be working with us more closely to achieve this goal. Beginning this fall, the UNA will be hosting several Meet and Greet events in which members of the community can meet some of UBC’s best athletes, learn about their teams, and maybe challenge them in a friendly game!

In the meantime, Gilles and everyone here at the UNA would like to hear from you. If you have ideas about how we can better connect members of the community with UBC Athletics, feel free to contact Gilles at <a href="mailto:gilles.lepine@ubc.ca">gilles.lepine@ubc.ca</a>, or speak with our very own Program Manager, Andrew, at <a href="mailto:andrew.clements@myuna.ca">andrew.clements@myuna.ca</a>. Of course, you are always welcome to stop by Wesbrook Community Centre or the Old Barn Community Centre and chat with us! As Gilles would say, why not?]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Parking at the University Neighbourhoods Association]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>Parking your vehicle within the UNA community can sometimes be a puzzling task.</h2>
Why do cars get towed rather than receive tickets? How do you get a parking pass for you and your visiting family? And why do parking policies in some neighbourhoods differ from others? As part of our ongoing commitment to communicating with residents, we would like to outline the basics of parking within our community and introduce the next steps in developing our Parking Management Strategy. This is important information for all new or well-established residents, as well as your visiting family and friends.

Let’s first look at the history of roads in our community. You may not know that the roads at UBC are private – owned by UBC. But when UBC decided to develop its surplus land for housing, the roads in the neighbourhoods had to be public. In the absence of a municipality,  The Province gave the jurisdiction for the roads to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTI). Under MoTI, these roads are considered within the Highway Act; this means that the roads are deemed “common and public highways”. That’s right, our roads are technically highways! Because of this interesting technicality, MoTI only has the authority to tow violating vehicles  and cannot fine drivers by issuing tickets. That’s why on our neighbourhood roads, towing is required in response to all parking violations, even if it’s a first offence.

In 2012, the UNA established a Parking Management Strategy with the assistance of UBC and MoTI, with the goal of providing residents and visitors an opportunity to park their vehicles in UNA neighbourhoods. This strategy was, and still is, meant to prioritize residents, their friends and family, neighbourhood service vehicles, and shoppers in the commercial cores of the community. We began by offering parking passes to residents of Hawthorn Place and Wesbrook Village, and we have been working hard to respond to resident and visitor parking needs since then.[dt_gap height="20" /]
<h3>So what kind of parking passes are available for residents and their visitors?</h3>
First, it’s important to note that all passes we offer are available only for residents of Hawthorn Place and Wesbrook Place. Residents, you are eligible to purchase a <strong>Resident Parking Decal</strong> that allows you to park your vehicle on your neighbourhood streets. These decals are valid from <em>April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018</em>. Please note that your Resident Parking Decal is only valid for the neighbourhood in which you reside, and they are assigned to your specific vehicle license plate number. You also have the option of purchasing additional Resident Parking Decals, in accordance to the fee schedule, for your additional vehicles. One <strong>Visitor Parking Permit</strong> is available for purchase to each UNA household, and allows your visitors to park their vehicles in your neighbourhood. Visitor Parking Permits are assigned to your specific UNA address. We also offer complimentary to UNA residents who need occasional extra parking for their visitors.

all it takes is an easy visit to the UNA Office, located at #202-5923 Berton Avenue, in Wesbrook Village (above the RBC). The UNA Office accepts Visa, MasterCard, Debit, and Cash as your method of payment. Don’t forget to bring appropriate identification as well as vehicle and ICBC insurance information. For full details on necessary documentation, visit <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/residential-services/parking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.myuna.ca/residential-services/parking/</a>.

Here are some important tips to remember: always display your valid Resident Parking Decal in the upper left corner of your vehicle’s windshield and inform your guests to display your Visitor Parking Permit or Visitor Day Pass on their rear view . Make sure to renew your pass by March 31<sup>st</sup> every year. Read and follow the directions on neighbourhood street signs – don’t take any chances by parking over the time limit or without a valid pass, because you will be towed! If you follow the rules and parking signs in our community, parking your vehicle will be a breeze. But if you feel that you have been towed, you may fill out a Parking Violation Dispute Application and submit it to the UNA Office along with your towing receipt and Notice to Tow.[dt_gap height="20" /]

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1913 size-large" title="Your Guide to Parking in the UNA community" src="https://wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CampusResident-May2017-FINAL2-700x1024.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1024" />[dt_gap height="30" /]

Here at the UNA, we try to make parking in the community as simple and accessible as possible, but we are increasingly faced with a unique set of challenges: our neighbourhoods are expanding, which means our population and number of vehicles are growing; due to daily influxes of students, faculty, staff and UBC visitors who avoid parking at UBC’s parkades, residents may sometimes find themselves without a parking space; and residents of Wesbrook Place are restricted to one parking stall per household under their building’s development permit.

In addition to these challenges, not all five neighbourhoods share the same parking policies and regulations. For example, while the UNA manages and issues parking passes to residents of Hawthorn Place and Wesbrook Place, Hampton Place residents do not currently require permits because there is ample parking both on the street and in the strata buildings. But in Chancellor Place and East Campus, there are hardly any on-street parking areas. Understanding all the different parking procedures in each of the five neighbourhoods can be headache-inducing!

That is why this year, the UNA has begun to develop its Parking Management Strategy in order to align all five neighbourhood parking policies and regulations into one straightforward UNA Parking Management Strategy. Right now, we are in the very beginning stages of developing this strategy. Some other matters we will be looking into include expanding the available car-sharing programs (Modo, Zipcar, Car2Go, and Evo) and extending parking invigilation hours. All five UNA neighbourhoods will be included in developing this strategy, and we will be seeking your input and feedback when we have formulated a strategic and detailed proposal.[dt_gap height="20" /]
<h3>Sustainability will be our guiding principle in developing this strategy.</h3>
We will be working hard on this over the summer because we want the UNA community to be financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable. In the meantime, we encourage all UNA residents and visitors to try and incorporate sustainable transport more deeply into your daily lives. There are many sustainable alternatives to driving your vehicle to and within our neighbourhoods, and they are often much easier and more convenient. And with the weather becoming warm and sunny, there’s no better time to start riding your bicycle or walking in your community.

If walking or cycling is not an option, consider taking our city’s easy and accessible transit. Did you know that there are 4 buses and 2 express buses that can take you to and from UBC and the UNA community? There are also 2 community shuttle buses, the C18 and the C20, offering shorter trips in the area. The C18 runs counterclockwise from the UBC Bus Loop to West Mall near student residences, and the C20 runs clockwise from the UBC Bus Loop to Marine drive, offering stops at St. John’s Hospice and the UBC Botanical Gardens. For all smartphone users out there, we recommend downloading a real-time bus tracker app that can help you plan your trip as well as show bus stop information and GPS bus tracking.

And if you really love to drive but want to take sustainable transport, consider using our community’s car-sharing programs: Modo, Zipcar, Car2Go, and Evo (you can sign up at <a href="http://modo.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modo.coop</a>, <a href="http://zipcar.ca/vancouver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zipcar.ca/vancouver</a>, <a href="http://car2go.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">car2go.com</a>, <a href="http://evo.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evo.ca</a>). Car2Go and Evo are great for short or long trips because they are meant to be used one-way. Simply pick the car nearest to you, and when you are finished driving it, you can leave it at any designated parking locations within the UNA or approved spot in Vancouver. For shorter neighbourhood trips, Modo and Zipcar are perfect because you can use the vehicles in 15-minute increments and park the car in the same spot you picked it up. No more driving around looking for a parking spot![dt_gap height="20" /]
<h3>We hope that all UNA residents and visitors have benefited and will continue to benefit from the UNA’s Parking Management Strategy.</h3>
We look forward to developing this strategy with the goal of improving the lives of all community members, friends, and families.

		<title><![CDATA[UNA Youth Launch Mental Health Awareness Club]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h2>We Are Community and the UNA youth would like to introduce you to the <em>Know Yourself Youth Psychology Club</em>!</h2>
What began as a weekly club for youth to learn about mental health topics is quickly becoming a unique and powerful initiative to raise awareness about the many issues affecting young minds in our community.

The <em>Know Yourself Club</em> was launched in the fall of 2016 by We Are Community’s Youth Coordinator, Taylor Scott, and a group of students interested in learning more about psychology and mental health. Being so close to UBC and seeing all its mental health awareness campaigns, the students questioned why they didn’t have the same kinds of resources to understanding mental health. Especially in a university environment that places so much importance on academic excellence, the youth in our community can feel a lot of pressure to succeed, leading to negative consequences on their mental well-being.

As a former UBC student himself, Taylor Scott understands this academic pressure and agrees that high school-aged students are tremendously underrepresented in the world of mental health. More should be done to connect them with not only the support and resources they need but also to the dialogue and research behind mental well-being. Taylor has taken inspiration from UBC’s Santa Ono who champions mental health awareness and claims that mental health support is a fundamental right.
<h3>The club encompasses a model of well-being,</h3>
where students should feel comfortable sharing ideas, stories, and experiences in a safe and non-judgmental space. It encourages UHill and other high school students to learn about psychology, start healthy dialogues with each other and friends and family, reduce stigmas about mental health issues affecting youth, and raise awareness throughout the community.

The club meets once per week under the guidance of Li Shao, a Registered Clinical Counsellor with many years’ experience. Li teaches the students how to properly read and interpret scholarly articles, and encourages them to do their own research. With this foundation, students are better equipped to think and talk about mental health and can successfully spread informed knowledge to members of the community. Just last month at BC’s Youth Week Celebration, the club members handed out over 100 pamphlets they had created that were all about sleep disorders and the effects of sleep deprivation.
<h3>The club is still young, but the members have ambitious plans for the future.</h3>
They’re planning to launch a webpage devoted to their club and youth mental health, which will be located on We Are Community’s <a href="http://www.wearecommunityvan.ca">website</a>. In the fall they intend to host lectures, movie nights, and plenty more events, all with the goal of spreading awareness about the issues that are relevant and important to them.

So how can you get involved, or simply support this club? If you are a youth (13-18 years old), within or outside of the UNA community, join the club! They meet every Thursday 4-5pm at Wesbrook Community Centre from September to June. If you are someone in the field of psychology or related areas and would like to find out how you can support this great initiative, contact Taylor Scott at <a href="mailto:tscott@myuna.ca">tscott@myuna.ca</a>. And be sure to keep up-to-date with our weekly newsletter, website, and the <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/publications/campus-resident-newspaper/">Campus Resident Newspaper</a> for more to come on the <em>Know Yourself Youth Psychology Club</em>!]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[On <strong>Tuesday, November 14th</strong> we began the switch over to our new website design. This update addresses website functionality and aims to improve communication from the UNA. Our goal is to provide UNA residents with more user friendly access to all UNA updates and content.

As part of our website update, some content has been displaced and some links have stopped working. We are aware of issues with the new UNA website and are working to resolve them quickly. Thank you for your continued patience during this transition period. We will be providing continued updates with more information this week.

		<title><![CDATA['- SNOW REMOVAL ADVISORY -]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The UNA continues to respond to adverse weather conditions and will increase snow and ice removal resources as required.

This winter has been uncharacteristically wintery with numerous bouts of cold overnight temperatures and snow events. With each event, UNA-contracted crews have been deployed to clear and salt sidewalks, letdowns and pathways within the neighbourhoods. UBC crews have also been dispatched to clear and salt roadways within the UNA and UBC academic realm, in addition to key campus walkways, the bus loop and approaches to the hospital

Similar to other municipalities in the Lower Mainland, the responsibility for snow removal is a balance of the local property owners and local government crews. As with other municipalities this winter, there remains significant snow and ice on side streets, and on sidewalks, if an owner has not taken the appropriate steps to clear snow and ice from the path adjacent to their property.

The UNA will continue to proactively monitor and respond to the on-going weather conditions. UNA staff would like to remind residents to stay safe and be extra careful when walking outside or driving. We also urge that building owners be extra vigilant and keep their sidewalks clear and salted/sanded.

		<content><![CDATA[<h3><strong>UNA Snow and Ice Removal Bylaw</strong>
Public Consultation September 19 – October 3</h3>
The UNA is seeking feedback from UBC residents on a draft Snow and Ice Removal Bylaw. Your feedback is important as it will inform the approval process of this new bylaw. <strong>Please submit comments via email by October 3</strong> at <a href="mailto:reception@myuna.ca">reception@myuna.ca</a>. Submission should also include what building you live in.

<a href="http://myunaold.wearecommunityvan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DRAFT_Snow_and_Ice_Removal_Bylaw_FOR_CONSULTATION_SEP_2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is the link</a> to view the draft bylaw.

<strong>About the Snow and Ice Removal Bylaw</strong>
The purpose of the bylaw is to keep neighbourhood sidewalks safe for people following a snowfall or ice buildup. The bylaw establishes responsibilities for residential and commercial properties to clear snow and ice from the full width of sidewalks that surround the properties by 10am on the morning following a snowfall, seven days a week. This is a best practice used across the Lower Mainland. The bylaw has been tailored to the UNA/UBC context.

The bylaw is structured to ensure that snow and ice is removed in a timely manner so that sidewalks are kept safe for travel. In the event that snow and ice is not removed in time, the snow will be removed and the costs of the removal will be at the expense of the relevant parties.]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[AGM and Election - New Date: January 9th]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There have been a number of inquiries about the director election and the AGM . Given the volume of information this year with proposed new by-laws we decided to separate the AGM notice from the election package. We discovered with the AGM notice that the mail was taking much longer than we had been advised. It became apparent that there was a real risk with the election ballots that they may not be received in time for the AGM.</span></p>
<span class="s1">We sought advice on how best to proceed and the Board met on November 2</span><span class="s2"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s1">. Directors Cottle and Zhou recused themselves from the discussion and decision. After reviewing all the options the Board decided not to run the risk of receiving ballots after the AGM.</span>

<strong><span class="s1">The AGM will now take place at the Old Barn Community Centre from 7 to 9 pm on January 9</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>, 2018</strong>. The candidates whose nominations have been accepted have been notified. We will be posting their names on the website next week and have asked them to refrain from campaigning until the extension of time for nominations that is now required has ended.</span>

<span class="s1">Once an AGM has been cancelled and then rescheduled all the notice requirements take effect afresh. The January date allows for mail to be sent and received over the holiday season.</span>

<span class="s1">The new timelines will be posted on the website as will candidate and AGM information. There will be an all candidates forum and an election newsletter as previously planned.</span>

<span class="s1">We are still hosting an <strong>Open House on November 18</strong></span><strong><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span></strong><span class="s1"> from 2 to 4 pm to answer any questions about the proposed new by-laws.</span>

Please contact me directly should you have questions.

<span class="s1">I would like to thank all of you who have been generous with your feedback and gracious about the change of date.</span>

		<title><![CDATA[It's Time Project]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]The It’s Time project is looking at how to improve Metro Vancouver’s road transportation network using something called <u><a href="https://www.itstimemv.ca/decongestion-charging.html">decongestion charging</a></u>. Decongestion charging is already making travel easier for people in many other major cities around the world such as Singapore, Stockholm, and London. Here in Metro Vancouver we have been paying for road use through the fuel tax and the recently removed bridge tolls. Unfortunately, the way charging has been structured in the region isn’t actually addressing congestion where it’s most needed, wasn’t always fair, and isn’t generating the revenue we need to upgrade and maintain our transportation system.

		<title><![CDATA[UNA Snow Removal Plan - Update]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The UNA takes snow removal seriously and is making consistent, coordinated efforts with UBC Building Operations to keep main throughways and sidewalks clear.

Report icy sidewalks to UNA snow removal crews by submitting an email to <a href="mailto:snow@myuna.ca">snow@myuna.ca</a>.
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>The UBC Snow Removal Routes:</strong></h2>
The UNA contracts UBC Building Operations for snow removal on roads.

The focus of UBC Building Operations is to keep ice from forming on roadways and to mobilize when the forecast gives us reason to believe we have ice concerns for roads.  As the snow starts to fall, UBC Building Operations will start to plow when the accumulation of snow reaches about 2 inches and carry on with this until the snow event ends.

Residents are encouraged to take the closest 1<sup>st</sup> priority route for commuting purposes. For 1<sup>st</sup> Priority please referred to <em><strong><a href="http://buildingoperations.ubc.ca/resources/snow-plan/">UBC Snow Removal Map</a></strong></em>.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>The UNA Sidewalk Snow Removal Plan:</strong></h2>
The UNA snow removal crews work to ensure residents have access to key areas in the neighbourhood.

The UNA will prioritize the following locations for snow and ice removal (<a href="https://www.myuna.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Snow-Removal-Prority-Sidewalks_Pathways_Roads_ALL-NEIGHBOURHOODS-V3.0.pdf"><strong><em>UNA Sidewalks Maps</em></strong></a>):
<ul>
 	<li>Sidewalk around Essential Services</li>
 	<li>Sidewalk around Community Centres</li>
 	<li>Sidewalks around school</li>
 	<li>School routes</li>
 	<li>High traffic sidewalks that are connected to main UBC walkways</li>
 	<li>Sidewalks around bus stops</li>
 	<li>Major crosswalks and letdowns</li>
</ul>
The focus of UNA snow removal crews is to keep ice from forming on sidewalks. Ice maintenance services will perform based on the weather forecast. Snow removal service will begin when 2” – 3” of snow has accumulated.

Our snow removal crews will prioritize their work to ensure residents are able to access key areas in the neighbourhood. Snow removal crews will first tackle 1<sup>st</sup> Priority sidewalks and then branch out toward 2<sup>nd</sup> Priority sidewalks.

In order to maximize efficiency, snow removal crews will focus on one neighbourhood at a time. Snow removal will begin in <strong>Wesbrook Place</strong> and <strong>Hawthorn Place</strong> neighbourhoods, and then extend their service to nearby neighbourhoods.

The public is encouraged to do their part to keep sidewalks around their property clear of snow and ice.

*In the case of extreme weather conditions, snow removal crews may face significant challenges to travel back to the UNA area due to uncontrollable circumstances. Please note this may significantly impact our snow and ice removal operations. UNA snow removal crews will make their very best efforts to prioritize, and perform removal service with the resource that is available under extreme conditions.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Snow Removal Outside of UBC and UNA:</strong></h2>
The roads of the UBC Endowment Lands, including Southwest Marine Drive from 41st to 16th ave and Chancellor Blvd from Westbrook Mall to Alma are managed by Mainroad under contract with the Provincial Government of BC.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="ONLINE CONSULTATION | 2018 - 2019 OPERATING BUDGET" i_icon_fontawesome="fa fa-desktop" i_color="custom" title_align="separator_align_left" add_icon="true" i_custom_color="#3b7267"][vc_column_text]Residents have been asking us to improve the way we communicate and increase engagement in the community. In response, we are providing residents with more information related to the fiscal challenges we’re experiencing, and the steps underway to address these significant financial challenges. Our ability to generate revenue directly affects our ability to serve our community. We believe it’s important for residents in the university neighbourhoods to be informed about our budget decisions and the impacts on residents. Over the next two weeks, we are seeking your comments and feedback surrounding the information provided on this page and through social media.

To participate in this online consultation, please provide feedback by email to <a href="mailto:finance@myuna.ca?&amp;subject=2018%20-%202019%20Operating%20Budget%20Feedback">finance@myuna.ca</a>.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="OUR CHALLENGE - DECREASING REVENUES" i_icon_fontawesome="fa fa-area-chart" i_color="custom" title_align="separator_align_left" add_icon="true" i_custom_color="#3b7267"][vc_column_text]<strong>DECREASING REVENUES</strong>
Over the past five years, the UNA’s revenue from the UBC Services Levy has dropped by 30%. UNA receives the bulk of its funding from the UBC Services Levy, which is one of the two property tax‐like charges paid by property owners in the university neighbourhoods. In 2012, the Services Levy revenue was nearly $4 million. By 2017 it dropped to $2.8 million. Over the same five years, population in the university neighbourhoods increased by 48% (from 8,600 residents in 2012 to 12,700 in 2017).[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>WHY ARE UNA REVENUES DROPPING?</strong>
It’s all about the declining property tax rate – also called mill rate – and both the UNA and UBC do not have any control over this annual rate.
Here’s how it works:

The amount paid for property taxes is a combination of the mill rate and property value. Each year, a local government decides what they want to spend on services. Then they take all the property values in the area and set the mill rate to collect enough taxes to deliver those services. If property values rise faster than the budget, the mill rate is lowered, even though the amount you paid in property taxes increases. At UBC, residents pay two property tax‐like fees:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Provincial Rural Tax: </strong>This goes directly to the provincial government, which sets the rate. This tax is to help pay for rural area public services, in particular local road maintenance and policing.</li>
 	<li><strong>UBC Services Levy: </strong>A portion of this levy is retained by UBC to pay certain expenses relating to the neighbourhoods and to add to reserves. The remainder is transferred to the UNA to pay for services such as recreation programs and facilities, landscaping and road maintenance.</li>
</ul>
At UBC, the mill rate for these two fees added together must be the same as if your property was in the City of Vancouver. Vancouver mill rates have been declining rapidly because of a significant increase in property values – including large estates, single family homes, and multi‐family homes. Vancouver can charge lower mill rates, but still collect more revenue for its budget each year given these property value increases. Unfortunately, this formula is not working for university neighbourhoods, which are not increasing in value at the same pace. As a result, each year there is less revenue available for UNA services. The UNA and UBC have no control over this mill rate. Over the past few years this has resulted in a continued decline in the revenue available for UNA services. At the same time, expenses have continued to increase due primarily to increased population, which affects cost of services (e.g. water and sewer), capital investment (e.g. new recreation centre), and the province’s decision to recover fire services costs from UBC neighbourhoods.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>IMPACT ON RESIDENTS</strong>

A continued decline in revenue results in difficulty:
<ul>
 	<li>Maintaining current service levels</li>
 	<li>Implementing new requests for programs and services</li>
 	<li>Maintaining a sustainable financial model</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="MEASURES TO PROTECT SERVICES" i_icon_fontawesome="fa fa-pie-chart" i_color="custom" title_align="separator_align_left" add_icon="true" i_custom_color="#3b7267"][vc_column_text]<b>PROTECTING SERVICES</b>
Starting in 2014, the UNA’s expenses have exceeded its revenue. Simply put – there has not been enough money coming in through the UBC Services Levy and other revenue sources to cover operational costs. The province’s decision to recover fire costs from UBC’s neighbourhoods placed additional pressure on UNA’s resources. A Joint Financial Task Force was created, with representatives from the UNA and UBC, to address the growing financial pressures caused by the funding deficit.

A number of measures have been implemented to maintain services:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reduced UNA administrative costs.</strong> The UNA reduced its administration costs, which resulted in operational cost savings without reductions to service levels. The UNA also moved into smaller office space, which has reduced rent costs by 40%.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduced fees paid to UBC.</strong> UBC committed to five years of financial support to the UNA by reducing fees and administrative costs that the UNA pays UBC for service delivery.</li>
 	<li><strong>Used reserve funds (savings).</strong> The reserve funds that were created to alleviate changes in revenue will be reduced to $500,000 in a contingency fund by 2019. The UNA and UBC are working together to determine strategies to manage operations, as well as exploring options for a more sustainable finance model.</li>

Strategies for budget management over the next four years are limited to factors that UBC and the UNA can influence. Neither the UNA nor UBC alone can change the Services Levy rate to generate more revenue. They have taken steps to address this issue and have completed a service review that has identified opportunities to improve the efficiency of operations and enhance the resiliency of the UNA’s finances. A number of strategies are being implemented over the next few years:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Collaborate on services.</strong> UNA and UBC are exploring a number of options to collaborate on a variety of services. For example, community centre and neighbourhood field rentals are now managed by UBC recreation staff, reducing UNA costs and improving services.</li>
 	<li><strong>UBC Community Services Grant.</strong> UBC has committed to 4 years of additional financial support through a Community Services Grant, funded by land development proceeds.</li>
 	<li><strong>Restructure UNA administration staff.</strong> The UNA has restructured from an Executive Director and an Operations Director to a management team of an Executive Director and three managers –Recreation, Operations and Finance. This was accomplished without cost increases and provides support for more responsive service delivery.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduce office space.</strong> The UNA recently moved into a smaller office space which reduced rent costs by 40%.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review Operations.</strong> A more detailed operations review is in progress to review internal resource allocation to maximize staff skills and expertise. In the interim, two staff vacancies have not been filled.</li>
</ul>

		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="Land Use 101 - Event Summary" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On April 16, 2018 over 70 residents attended a presentation by Michael White, Associate VP, Campus and Community Planning and Aubrey Kelly, CEO of UBC Properties Trust, gave a presentation on land use at UBC, followed by a question and answer period. This topic was suggested by a number of residents who attended the Strata 101 workshops held this winter. The UNA looks forward to facilitating and supporting more presentations on topics of community interest.</span><span class="s2">
</span>[/vc_column_text][vc_btn title="PDF of Presentation" align="center" i_icon_fontawesome="fa fa-file-text-o" add_icon="true" link="url:http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myuna.ca%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F05%2FLand-Use-101.pdf||target:%20_blank|"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="Resident Feedback" title_align="separator_align_left"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I found the presentation gave an excellent overview of the work of UBC Property Trust and association with C&amp;CP. I was unaware that Property Trust functioned as an integrated business with its own responsibilities to arrange financing, vet builders and manage complexes. Also it was interesting to learn that a dividend was paid to UBC annually!”<strong> - UNA Resident</strong></span></p>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The format was a great way to allow residents to raise issues with senior people at the University and to have a larger number of people than normal hear the answers. It was important to get confirmation that the 2011 approval of 993,000 sq. ft. of residential floor space for the Stadium Road Neighbourhood was, in fact, the last allocation actually approved by the Board of Governors and the BC Government.  We know that the Board has subsequently said (in the context of the Game Plan) that a rebuilt Stadium would be funded through incremental revenue from its optimal siting (allowing for more market housing), and that more housing for Faculty and Staff is planned, but that figures we have heard of an increase to 1.5 million sq. ft. of residential floor space in the Stadium Road Neighbourhood are, at this stage, merely hypothetical, not approved.  It was also very important to hear from Faculty members their concerns not only regarding sufficient housing, but also rental rates that are rising faster than their salaries.  I would love to see another such forum to help residents understand the how development of these neighbourhoods contributes to the endowment of the University and what some of the assumptions behind monetizing the endowed lands are.” <strong>- UNA Resident</strong></span></p>

As last year, event bands and DJs are not permitted to bring a bass-dedicated speaker to MOA’s Grounds, and all speakers must be facing the ocean instead of back to campus. MOA has taken steps to reduce noise impact to our neighbours, but on occasion some music may be detected, and we are grateful for your understanding.

		<title><![CDATA[Neighbourhood Dog Etiquette]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Neighbourhood Dog Etiquette</strong></h1>
As the weather gets warmer and people are spending more time outside, we want to take this opportunity to remind our residents of some general guidelines for owning and interacting with dogs in the community.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pick it up. </strong>Bring several bags on your walks to be sure you have enough. If you run out, either come back and clean it up later, or ask another dog walker if they have a bag to spare.</li>
 	<li><strong>Always leash your dog on walks. </strong>Not everyone is comfortable around dogs. Keep your dog close to you and stay alert to others. Your leash should be short enough to prevent your dog from contacting or jumping on passersby.</li>
 	<li><strong>Prevent barking</strong>. Practice getting your dog’s attention to easily redirect them if they bark at people or other dogs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Only let your dog greet a stranger if they ask. </strong>The same rules apply if you see another dog and owner approaching. Ask first and respect the other’s response.</li>
 	<li><strong>Be aware of other people's feelings.</strong> If your dog does something to upset someone (jumping up, barking) apologize to them and take measures to prevent the situation from reoccurring.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enroll your dog in Polite Paws</strong>. This dog training program, offered by the UNA, will equip you and your dog with all the necessary skills and knowledge to happily function in the community. Interested? Sign-up <a href="https://ca.apm.activecommunities.com/myunarecreation/activity_search/polite-paws/4373?">here.</a></li>

<h2>Your Passport to Wellbeing</h2>
This is a <strong>FREE</strong> 12-week program consisting of 50+ activities for seniors to improve their physical strength, mental health and social wellbeing. Anyone 55 and over is welcome to participate. The project will start on September 15th with a welcome party – all seniors are invited to join. Programmed activities will start from the week of September 17th until the week of December 2nd, with a wrap up party on December 8th. The program activities will take place all across campus - with many at Wesbrook and the Old Barn Community Centre, others will be in our partners facilities, including UBC Aquatic Centre, Osborne Centre, UBC Botanical Garden, Roy Barnett Recital Hall, and TRIUMF.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most activities are senior friendly and accessible to all abilities, with a few exceptions. These details will be program specific and listed in </span><span class="s2">the Passport</span><span class="s1"> next to each program. The activities will be led by paid instructors as well as Senior Ambassador Volunteers. We hope through trying out these different activities first hand, seniors will discover their own path to wellbeing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your Passport to Wellbeing is funded by Employment and Social Development Canada under its New Horizons for Seniors Program.</span></p>

		<content><![CDATA[<strong>Sustainability Tips - October</strong>

Did you know that sustainability includes financial, social, and environmental factors? While sustainability is often linked most closely with environment, all three are equally important when considering sustainable action. Practices and products that are truly sustainable are able to continue indefinitely, without harm to people, the planet, or profit.

Some simple (yet impactful) actions you can make to incorporate sustainability best practices into our life!

<strong>Thanksgiving</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Use you veggie + turkey scraps to make soup</li>
 	<li>Freeze your leftovers to decrease food waste</li>
 	<li>Ditch the disposable and invest in cloth napkins</li>
 	<li>Make sure your guests know where recycling and compost goes</li>
 	<li>Put fats, oils, and greases into your green bin (not down the drain!)</li>
 	<li>Visit the UBC Farm and enjoy local, seasonal produce!</li>
</ul>

<strong>Halloween</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Recreate or reuse costumes (Check out your local thrift stores – The SPCA Thrift store and The Salvation Army Thrift Store)</li>
 	<li>Choose Fairtrade, organic, non-GMO treat options</li>
 	<li>Hand out non-candy treats (stickers, play dough, toys)</li>
 	<li>Don’t purchase individually packaged treats for home or work</li>
 	<li>Send your kids out with reusable buckets and pillow cases</li>
 	<li>Purchase locally grown pumpkins to carve (and compost them afterwards)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Starting the Rainy Season off Right </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Keep your thermostat below 22 C (day) and 19 C (night)</li>
 	<li>Invest in a good quality umbrella (one that won’t blow inside out)</li>
 	<li>Collect outdoor rainwater for indoor plants</li>
 	<li>Check the pressure in your tires to increase fuel efficiency</li>
 	<li>Repurpose unwearable summer clothes as rags</li>
</ul>

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - Mini-Tips to Reduce Costs From Standby Power]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Standby Power</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Did you know that 10% of the average B.C. electricity bill is from devices that are turned off, but still plugged in? This is called Standby Power (also known as vampire power or phantom load). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some particularly high-draining devices are: TVs, video game consoles, cable/satellite TV boxes, plugged in laptops (non-charging)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To avoid standby power + decrease your electricity bill:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Unplug devices when not in use (especially lesser-used electronics, such as extra TVs, video game consoles, and stereos)</span></li>
 	<li class="p1">Unplug all devices when you go on vacation</li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Use a power bar/smart strip to conveniently turn off devices when not in use (especially older appliances that drain more energy)</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Look for the ENERGY STAR® label when purchasing electronics</span></li>
 	<li class="p1">Disable computer screen savers (They use twice as much energy as putting your computer in sleep mode!)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Buy Local!</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buying local produce (grown in BC) is a great way to reduce the impact of your food purchases! Purchasing local, seasonal items not only reduces the environmental impact, but can also be more nutritious and tasty as there is less time and distance between the farm and your table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

		<title><![CDATA[UBC-UNA Neighbourhoods Liaison Committee Meeting eBrief]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<h1><strong>UBC-UNA Neighbourhoods Liaison Committee Meeting eBrief</strong></h1>
<strong>
November 5, 2018</strong>

The UBC-UNA Neighbourhoods Liaison Committee was formalized in April 2018 as part of the evolving partnership between UBC and the UNA and in recognition of the role of the UNA as an advisory body to the UBC Board of Governors. The Liaison Committee is co-chaired by the UNA Board Chair and Chair of the Property Committee of the UBC Board of Governors. The voting members of the Committee includes its co-chairs; the chairs of the Finance and Governance Committee of the UBC Board of Governors; a UNA Board Director; and a UNA member at large. Non-voting members include UBC’s VP External Relations, AVP Campus and Community Planning, and the Executive Director of the UNA. The purpose of this committee is to discuss perspectives on issues of shared interest as an opportunity to work together and address areas of concern. The following provides a summary of key outcomes from the November 5th UBC-UNA Neighbourhoods Liaison Committee meeting. A number of issues were discussed including the UNA’s financial framework; emerging strategic priorities; evolving governance; and communications of this committee moving forward.

<strong>
UNA Financial Framework </strong>

The Committee discussed the current UNA financial status and received an update on the 2018 Services Levy revenue, which has increased for the first time in seven years due to a stabilization in Vancouver property tax rates. The UNA also discussed their five year budget projection, which forecasts financial stabilization beginning this year and reaching a balanced budget by 2021/2022. The Committee acknowledged the continuation of the UBC Community Services Grant to manage deficits from now until a balanced budget can be achieved. Staff will share the financial model and assumptions with the Liaison Committee, including sensitivity to Vancouver property value and tax rate changes, and will continue to monitor factors affecting the UNA budget in future years.

As part of this discussion, the UNA updated the Committee on work underway to benchmark community services and related costs that will help inform budget planning in future years. The results of this will be shared with the Liaison Committee for information once they are available.

The Committee also discussed the need to work together on a review of the UNA Reserves Policy to ensure long term financial sustainability. This work will be done in partnership with UBC and will be scoped with UNA Board input over the coming months, and brought back to the Liaison Committee for input.

A report back was provided to the Committee on discussions to date with the Province of BC with respect to the neighbourhood tax framework, including allocation of the general rural tax. Reference was made to the letter sent from the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing in 2017 that clarified the provincial stance of maintaining the current tax regime for the area. UBC will continue provincial engagement on this question into 2019.

<strong>
UNA Strategic Priorities </strong>

The UNA shared the emerging strategic priorities identified by the UNA Board through their strategic planning process and a brief summary of goals under each priority that will inform the staff and Board’s work over the coming three years. The priorities include: UNA governance; financial sustainability; operational capacity; and community and stakeholder relations. As progress is made, updates will be brought back to the Liaison Committee under each priority area.

<strong>
Evolving Governance </strong>

The UNA updated the Committee on the Strategic Plan goal of governance. This includes an exploration of opportunities to evolve governance in a way that meets the needs of a growing community. Specific items discussed in detail included ways to expand UNA membership, as well as the UNA’s bylaw updates, which may include a review of UNA Board composition and voting rights of directors. UBC committed to working in partnership with the UNA to explore this further and a report will be brought back to the next Liaison Committee meeting pending conclusion of a UNA bylaw review process.

<strong>
Communication </strong>

The Committee discussed the value of reporting back to the broader community on key outcomes of the Committee discussions and will be using this template moving forward to share information.

<strong>
Next Meeting</strong>

The next meeting of the Committee is targeted to take place in spring 2019.]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]The University Neighbourhoods Association's <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/governance/strategic-plan/">Strategic Plan</a> is for 2019 - 2021.

This is the UNA’s first <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/governance/strategic-plan/">Strategic Plan</a>, developed by the Board and senior management over a number of months. The size of the community and the complexity of the issues facing it require a new approach to address them. This is a practical plan, rooted in concrete actions that will be developed annually as mechanisms to meet the goals defined below.

There is no shortage of good ideas or initiatives that would benefit the community as a whole. Every municipal-like entity whether it is a not-for-profit, a municipal council, or a regional district, is facing difficult decisions to ensure limited resources are appropriately allocated. This is a critical step for the UNA as it evolves to meet community needs.

The four strategic directions are listed in the <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/governance/strategic-plan/">Strategic Plan</a> with goals under each heading. They are not listed in any priority order as all four areas will be addressed over the next three years. The strategies will inform the actions taken to achieve the goals. Each year, as part of the planning and budget process, an annual work plan will be developed in parallel with the budget process to ensure that resources are allocated to priorities and any new initiatives or projects are appropriately resourced. Community and stakeholder engagement is a key element.

		<content><![CDATA[<h1>Reducing Our Energy Consumption</h1>
In October 2018 there was a natural gas pipeline rupture that reduced the Lower Mainland's natural gas supply to 85% capacity.

The <span class="s1">UNA took steps to reduce our energy consumption by lowering temperatures within our facilities. This change affected the Wesbrook Community Centre, Old Barn Community Centre, and UNA main office, starting December 14, 2018.
</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FortisBC is reporting that capacity has returned to normal levels and the threat of a shortage is now low. Although the immediate urgency has passed, t</span><span class="s1">he UNA is committed to continuing it's efforts in energy conservation</span>. Our community centres and office will continue to operate at reduced temperatures and we encourage residents to join us in our efforts.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - A Mini-Tip to Recycle it Right]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<strong>New Year – New Tips! </strong>

We are kicking off 2019 with some more sustainability tips for the community!

&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">Consider a Recycle it Right Resolution - With Your&nbsp;Coffee!</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recycling isn’t always straightforward. A prime example is the disposable coffee cup – an elusive character when it comes to proper disposal. Disposable coffee cups are one of the most commonly found items in garbage bins! (let’s change that).&nbsp;</span>The garbage bin is definitely the wrong place for these coffee cups, but where is the right place?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The parts of the coffee cup&nbsp;that come&nbsp;in contact with your drink&nbsp;(the lid and the cup) are&nbsp;considered container items. Even though they are made mostly of paper, coffee cups actually have a plastic lining, which can contaminate paper recycling if mixed in accidentally. Paper sleeves still go in paper recycling.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<table class="t1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="td1" style="text-align: right;" valign="top"><strong>Contact with Coffee?</strong></td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Container Recycling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1" style="text-align: right;" valign="top"><strong>Paper Sleeve?</strong></td>
<td class="td2" style="text-align: left;" valign="top">Paper Recycling!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">What about straws and splash sticks?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, these need to go straight in the garbage. Unnecessary waste is a big problem, so something you can do is reduce&nbsp;your use of these items, especially&nbsp;plastic ones! </span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, the BEST option is to use a reusable travel mug!&nbsp;If you do get a disposable coffee cup, please make sure to always find a recycling bin&nbsp;and&nbsp;recycle it right!</span></p>]]></content>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wesbrook Mall will be fully closed between Student Union Boulevard and University Boulevard to ALL traffic, cyclists and pedestrians starting <strong>January 14, 2019</strong>. This is necessary to complete the civil work and road work necessary for the opening of the new Bus Exchange and Exchange Residence. The largest impact is to traffic destined to Student Union Boulevard and the North Parkade. Detour routes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Detour route for traffic arriving from the east via University Boulevard is Blanca Street and Chancellor Boulevard. No traffic is to use the local neighbourhood streets within the University Endowment Lands.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Detour route for traffic arriving from the east via 16<sup>th</sup> Avenue is 16<sup>th</sup> Avenue west to SW Marine Drive then NW Marine Drive around the north end of the campus to Wesbrook Mall.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Detour route for traffic arriving from the south via SW Marine Drive is to continue on NW Marine Drive around the north end of campus to Wesbrook Mall.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Detour route for through traffic arriving from the north is either Chancellor Boulevard to Blanca Street to University Blvd or 16<sup>th</sup> Avenue, or NW Marine Drive to 16<sup>th</sup> Avenue.</li>

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - Mini-Tips to Loving Our Planet]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Valentine’s Day is a day where we make a bit of extra effort to show our loved ones that we care. When you’re thinking of how you can show or celebrate your love this year, why not consider doing it in ways that are also full of care for the environment, and the people and places that are impacted.

Here are some suggestions on how you can have minimal negative impact, and maximal positive ones![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong>1. When purchasing gifts, know when to say ‘Yes’ and when to say ‘No’</strong>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<strong>
2. Give yourself time:</strong>

Thinking ahead allows you to put a bit more thought into your actions. Give yourself time so that you don’t feel rushed to get a valentine’s gift ready for your loved one, or last-minute treats for your child’s classroom.

<strong>
3. Give an experience:</strong>

Some experience-based gifts include:
<ul>
 	<li>Cooking classes</li>
 	<li>Tickets (sports, concerts, movies)</li>
 	<li>Gift certificates (coffee shops, restaurants, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Fun activities (escape room, art gallery, bowling)</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_message icon_fontawesome="fa fa-heart"]<strong>Valentine’s Day Question: </strong>Do you put less thought into your decisions when you feel rushed?

If you are planning on making any purchases for valentine’s day this year, give yourself the time to think about the true impact of the item you are purchasing (Where did it come from? Who made it? How is it packaged? Can it be responsibly disposed of?). This doesn’t just apply to Valentine’s Day![/vc_message][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h3>Keep it Seasonal</h3>
<strong>What’s in season?</strong><strong> </strong>

Don’t forget to choose local! At this time of year, there are still many seasonal vegetables that are in abundance. This is the perfect time of year to enjoy those wintery root veggies for hearty dishes and stews. Another amazing benefit to living on the coast is our access to local fish and seafood.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - Spring Cleaning and Rethinking Our Closets]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Are you thinking of getting rid of items that no longer ‘spark joy’? Are you trying to clear out some clutter as spring approaches?

Decreasing clutter in your home is a great practice and can simplify many aspects of your day-to-day life. However – it’s important to go about it the right way and tidy up responsibly. It can feel great to rid yourself of clutter or “junk”, but don’t get carried away! Decluttering is only effective if you don’t fill up your newly created space with new stuff.

Once you do decide what you would like to get rid of - It may be tempting to throw everything in a big black garbage bag, but there is a much better way to do it. It is a lot easier than you think to properly dispose of your items and put as few items as possible in the trash.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h3><strong>Clearing out the Closet</strong></h3>
Check out Metro Vancouver’s latest waste reduction campaign: <a href="http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/solid-waste/projects-initiatives/think-thrice/Pages/default.aspx">Think thrice about your clothes</a>

Want to get the greatest value out of your clothing? Follow these steps:[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h4><strong>Step 1: Think before you buy!</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Does this item bring you joy? This is a question to ask BEFORE you purchase an item. Only buy an item of clothing if you know that you will love it (how it fits, how it looks) and will get plenty of use out of it.</li>
 	<li>Try your best not to make impulsive purchases.  Do you really need an item? If you haven’t thought about buying an item before you purchase it, most likely not.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h4><strong>Step 2: Can this item be repaired?</strong></h4>
Did your favourite shirt lose a button? Did the zipper on your coat break? Before tossing these items, fix them! Don’t know the first thing about fixing clothes?
<ul>
 	<li>Ask a parent/grandparent/neighbour</li>
 	<li>Attend a local repair workshop</li>
</ul>

</a></p>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h4><strong>Step 3: Does this item still have unused potential?</strong></h4>
<strong>Pass it on:</strong> Can one of your family or friends use this item?

This is a great (and often much appreciated!) way to extend the life of an item

<strong>Repurpose:</strong> Can you use it for something other than it’s originally intended purpose?

Why not cut up old clothes and use them as rags, instead of buying brand new cleaning clothes?

<strong>Donate it:</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The UBC Free Store</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubcfreestore/">UBC Free Store</a> accepts all usable items. All working household items, including appliances, clothes etc., can be dropped off at the UBC Free Store to be re-used by the UBC community.</p>

[/vc_column_text][vc_message icon_fontawesome="fa fa-question-circle-o"]<strong>Clothing Waste Question: </strong>How often do you make impulsive purchases?

One way to ensure you only purchase what you need is to have a plan and keep to it. If you really want something, you can plan for it and buy it next time! This not only helps you to stick to a budget, but it also keeps you from buying something you don’t really want or need that ultimately ends up as unnecessary waste.[/vc_message][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image="6741" img_size="1000x300"][/vc_column][vc_column][vc_column_text]

It is a day to bring awareness of some of the greatest environmental issues we currently face, including climate change, plastics pollutions, and threats to our endangered species.

<ol>
 	<li><strong>Come celebrate.</strong> The UNA Earth Day Celebration is happening on April 27! (We moved it back a week so it doesn't clash with Easter)</li>
 	<li><strong>Get Outside. </strong>Have fun and enjoy this beautiful planet!</li>
 	<li><strong>Do something nice for the planet.</strong> It's up to you to be the change that we need to see in the world! You could pick up some litter (#trashtag), donate to a conservation charity, or bring your own bag to the grocery store.</li>
 	<li><strong>Make one change.</strong> Altering one thing in your day that takes the planet into consideration is a great way to start! Make sure to reflect on the changes that you’ve already made and see how far you've come.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take a quiz.</strong> Test your knowledge and learn more about Climate Change, Ocean Health, and Biodiversity. <a href="https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-quiz/">https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-quiz/</a></li>

<h3>EASTER TIPS!</h3>
Make sustainable choices when you purchase chocolates and treats:
<ul>
 	<li>Choose Local (Purdy’s Chocolate, Thomas Haas, Gem Chocolates, Roger’s Chocolate (Victoria))</li>
 	<li>Choose Fairtrade (Roger’s Chocolate, Endangered Species Chocolate, Green and Blacks)</li>
 	<li>Avoid palm oil</li>
 	<li>Go easy on the treats and choose ones with as little packaging as possible</li>
 	<li>Choose paper instead of plastic</li>
 	<li>Attend an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/358435774758567/">Easter Egg Workshop</a> to learn how to make traditional, dyed Easter eggs!</li>
 	<li>Choose items that can be re-used (refillable Easter eggs, Easter baskets, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>TOSS IT OUT RESPONSIBLY</h3>
Did you know, in Metro Vancouver, a lot of items are actually banned from the waste bin?

<a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/waste-wizard.aspx">Waste Wizard</a>, while specific to the City of Vancouver, is still a useful tool and valuable guide when you are trying to understand what types of items can be recycled. You may be surprised that most items can be recycled if you know where to take them. <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/sustainability/depot/">The Green Depot</a> is always available to UNA and UBC members for the recycling of items not accepted in your household recycling. Likewise, <a href="https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/zero-waste-centre.aspx">Vancouver Zero Waste Centre</a> provides a convenient location for residents to drop off a wide range of materials for reuse and recycling, free of charge, including materials that require special handling or are in large quantities.

<h3>SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING</h3>
Choosing the most sustainable option can often be confusing and overwhelming. There are many considerations to make, and often times the pros and cons aren't clear.

Some of these considerations may include:
<ul>
 	<li>Where is it from? (Did it take a lot of energy to get here? Who was involved in its production?)</li>
 	<li>What is it made of? How is it made? (What resources went into it?)</li>
 	<li>How is it packaged? (Is there an alternative that has less packaging?)</li>
 	<li>How will I dispose of this item and its packaging? (Can the item and the packaging be re-used or at the very least, recycled?)</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_message message_box_color="grey" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-ellipsis-v"]<strong>DON'T KNOW WHICH TO CHOOSE? ... GO SIMPLE!</strong>[/vc_message][vc_column_text]As a general rule - THE SIMPLER THE BETTER

Choose items that:
<ul>
 	<li>are close to their natural/raw form</li>
 	<li>are made close to home</li>
 	<li>have the least amount of materials/ingredients</li>
 	<li>have the least amount of packaging (if any)</li>
</ul>
These rules apply to all material goods - including food.

Once you're able to identify certain products and product types that fit with your sustainability goals, budget, etc., these decisions become much easier. You just need to give a little bit of thought and effort to get it started.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>The most sustainable item is one that you don't buy.</strong>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h3><strong>GET YOUR TOTE ON!</strong></h3>
Check out our new Sustainability totes! These stylish bags are made from 100% cotton and are sturdy and long-lasting.

Many of the products that claim to be sustainable or 'green' are often poor quality and end up creating more waste rather than reducing it. Try to be selective with the items you choose and opt for good quality ones that will last years (not months).[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>Just because something is free - doesn't mean you have to accept it!</strong>[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image="7180" img_size="large" alignment="center" css=".vc_custom_1556827927669{border-radius: 4px !important;}"][vc_column_text]Purchase for $10 at the Old Barn Community Centre or Wesbrook Community Centre[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>Ways to use your tote:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Carry your groceries</li>
 	<li>Give as a gift (or use as gift wrapping for another gift!)</li>
 	<li>Use to carry your laptop to work or school</li>
 	<li>Use for kid's activities (ballet, music lessons, karate)</li>

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - What's the Deal with Buying Local?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h3>BUY LOCAL - WHY DO WE CARE?</h3>
Ever wonder why it's important to "buy local"? They are words we hear often but can be difficult to understand in a tangible way.

Buying local has social, economic, and environmental benefit and all three are inextricably linked. Let's look at why.

<strong>Economic benefit:</strong> In spending a dollar locally, it is more likely to pass through a greater number of hands (at a local level), thereby increasing the benefit within the community each time it does. When a dollar is spent outside of the community, the local benefit essentially stops with a single purchase.

A case study by LOCO BC (2013) has shown that local purchasing can re-circulate up to 33% of revenue directly to residents and businesses in B.C, compared to 17% and 19% from multinationals.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>When you buy locally, more money is likely to stay within the community.</strong></p>
<strong>Social benefit:</strong> Locally owned businesses are often more invested in a community and more dedicated to building and maintaining relationships with its members. Important social hubs within a community commonly develop around the physical space provided by these businesses. By purchasing locally, there is also increased transparency in the social effects on those involved in an item's production and transportation - this is much less clear when purchasing from a multi-national company or through online platforms.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Local businesses help build community.</strong></p>
<strong>Environmental benefit: </strong>Similarly to the social benefits, buying locally provides increased transparency in the resource and waste management practices associated with an item's production and transportation. If you have questions about a particular product, it's much more likely to be answered by a small business owner where the supply chain is shorter and less complicated. The presence of smaller stores in communities allows people to walk and drive shorter distances. Local businesses are also likely to use less land, and more likely to support other local businesses in their purchasing of good and services. These greatly reduce the greenhouse gas production associated with the transportation of goods, a major contributor.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Local purchasing can decrease environmental impact and provide increased environmental transparency. </strong></p>
Keeping items and funds in the local community supports the local economy while substantially decreasing the social and environmental impact of purchasing goods.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>When we make a purchase, it's important to think about where that money will go after we've spent it.</strong></p>
[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image="7254" img_size="full"][vc_column_text]
<h3>COMMUNITY YARD SALE</h3>
Have lots of clutter building up at home? Have you thought about hosting a table at the Community Yard Sale?

<strong>Reasons to host a table:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Get rid of clutter</li>
 	<li>Recover some of an item's purchasing cost</li>
 	<li>It's a fun activity for kids</li>
 	<li>Meet your neighbours</li>
 	<li>Contribute to the community by making usable, quality items accessible to your neighbours (so they don't have to go out a buy brand new ones)</li>
 	<li>Support the circular economy and reduce the consumption of valuable resources and the production of emissions</li>
</ul>
For more information, visit <a href="http://myuna.ca/yardsale">myuna.ca/yardsale</a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>When you purchase an item second-hand, it is close to "zero-impact", as no new resources were required for its production or transportation.</strong></p>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h3><strong>SHARING IN THE COMMUNITY</strong></h3>
<strong>SCRAP</strong>

Student Computer Repurposing Aid Program (SCRAP) is a newly launched program, funded by UTown@UBC. This youth-led program takes in computers (collected at the Green Depot), disassembles them, and reassembles the component into working computers, which are then donated to those in need.

<strong>Book Drive and Sale</strong>

The UNA-Utown@UBC Youth Leadership Group hosts a Book Sale every first and third Saturday of the month at Wesbrook Community Centre. Books are collected throughout the week at the same location. All funds collected from the drive are donated to the Variety Children's Charity.

<strong>UBC Free Store</strong>

THE UBC Free Store is a student-run program that provides a space for people to leave items they don't want or need. These items are then free for anybody to take!

8 a.m. - 11 p.m.
The Nest (UBC Campus), Room 2102

<strong>Rental Programs</strong>

The more people who share an item - the less impact it has! More and more rental programs are arising that replace the need for individually owned goods, especially ones that are infrequently used.

		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<h1><strong>UNA Executive Director Johanne Blenkin steps down effective June 14, 2019</strong></h1>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]The University Neighbourhoods Association (UNA) announced that Johanne Blenkin has stepped down from her role as UNA Executive Director effective June 14, 2019.

During her tenure as UNA Executive Director, Blenkin implemented improvements to both internal UNA operations and external community services, a foundational transformation necessary for the UNA to keep up with the growing needs of the community.

The UNA Board of Directors worked with Blenkin on setting a solid and clear strategic direction for 2019-2021 that focuses on strengthening UNA governance, establishing financial stability, improving operational capacity and engaging the community.

“Johanne has been a leader within the UNA and we thank her for all of her energy and drive to make the UNA a strong organization,” said UNA Chair Ying Zhou. “We wish her the very best in her future endeavours.”

Internally, Blenkin installed a more effective organizational structure while updating employee policies, training and professional development programs. She also improved financial reporting and reformed the budgeting process.

Externally, she’s credited with fostering a culture of respect and support that strengthened relationships with the community, UBC and other partner groups.

“I would like to thank my colleagues on staff for their hard work, ideas and enthusiasm,” said Blenkin. “It has been a pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you all every success now and in the future.”

With Blenkin’s departure, UNA Recreation Manager Andrew Clements and UNA Operations Manager Wegland Sit will act as Interim Co-Executive Directors.

The UNA is committed to building on the improvements that Blenkin has established and will continue to develop its services according to the needs of the community.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Due to other obligations, Nataliya Jatskevich has made the difficult decision to resign as an elected resident Director from the UNA Board of Directors.  The Board would like to thank Nataliya for her service and contributions.

UNA Bylaw 5.10 allows for the appointment by [Board] Directors of a [UNA] member to fill a vacancy in the Directors. As such, the Board has appointed Richard Alexander, previous Board Chair and six-year Board member to serve as interim Director up to the time of next election (to take place in the fall of 2019). Richard comes to the Board with knowledge and understanding of its structure and organization, and is prepared to assist over the short term. His interim appointment is effective June 24, 2019.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

<h1>The best way to BBQ ...</h1>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h2 style="text-align: center;">"Eat food, not too much, mostly plants"</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">(Michael Pollan)</h2>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Meat consumption has huge impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, land-use, water-use, and energy-use. One of the best ways you can decrease the impact of your summer BBQs (and eating habits in general) is by making simple adjustments to the amount of overall meat that is consumed.

<strong>Some quick and easy changes:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Offer chicken, fish, or veggie options, instead (or alongside) beef</li>
 	<li>Go heavy on the veggies and sides, and lighter on the meat</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_message icon_fontawesome="fa fa-shopping-basket"]You don't need to avoid meat entirely to decrease your impact[/vc_message][vc_text_separator title="What about ``Beyond Meat``?" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]This product has gained recent popularity and, alongside similar products, has been recognized as an excellent alternative to beef, in its ability to replicate taste and texture.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is it important?</span>

The "Beyond Meat" burger is the first time that comparable vegetarian/vegan options have been sold in fast-food chains. The fact that this type of burger is becoming more mainstream, means that it and other comparable products have the ability to gain popularity, especially with those who don't necessarily identify as being vegetarian/vegan. This product has also brought attention to the topic of meat consumption, and its effects on health, the environment, and on global systems.[/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_message icon_fontawesome="fa fa-globe"]A recent report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for big changes in farming and eating habits in order to reduce global land and water consumption. These changes are necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change. One key takeaway is that in transitioning to a more plant-based diet, we could save several million square kilometers of land to increase carbon sequestration.[/vc_message][vc_text_separator title="Comparing Different Burgers" title_align="separator_align_left"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - Strike While the Climate is Hot]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]September 27 was a big day for sustainable action. It concluded the Global Climate Strike, a week of youth-led protests, calling world leaders to take immediate action on the current climate crisis. Over 7.6 million people around the world mobilized to strike for climate action.

After the build-up and momentum, a lot of people are thinking...
<h3>What now?</h3>
What can each of us do? Whether you attended a climate strike or not, we can all use the strength of the global movement to propel us to take action.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_text_separator title="1. Educate Yourself" title_align="separator_align_left"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]
<ul>
 	<li>Climate change is a complex issue, but knowing the basics isn't difficult. (I.e. What is climate change? What are the impacts it's having and will have? What is the general direction we need to move it to mitigate these impacts?)</li>
 	<li>Having a grasp of the essential facts makes it easier to ask questions, increase your awareness, share knowledge and take action.</li>
 	<li>It's important to remain critical of the information you read. Sources found via social media should be treated with caution. Obtaining information from trusted news sources (CBC, New York Times, BBC) that include citations to academic journals is a better way to ensure that you're getting factual information.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://climateatlas.ca/">Climate Atlas of Canada</a> is an interactive tool for citizens, researchers, businesses and community leaders to learn about climate change in Canada.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">Global Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet</a> is a website created by NASA to provide the public with accurate and timely news and information about Earth’s changing climate, along with current data and visualizations, presented from the unique perspective of NASA, one of the world’s leading climate research agencies.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_text_separator title="2. Think about it" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]
<ul>
 	<li>Take intentional time to think about climate change. Think about what you already know, and what you would like to know more about.</li>
 	<li>Focus not just on the effects that climate change will have, but on the actions you can take in your life.</li>
 	<li>Take a look around you. What are others doing? How are people in your community responding to climate change?</li>
 	<li>Ask yourself the hard questions. Do you avoid thinking or talking about climate change?</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ol>
[/vc_column_text][vc_text_separator title="3. Talk about it" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]
<ul>
 	<li>Talk to your family, your friends and your neighbours about climate change.</li>
 	<li>Use conversations about climate change as an opportunity to listen and expand on your knowledge.</li>
 	<li>Talking about climate change can be challenging. While most people know that it's happening and will affect us, the topic can be uncomfortable. It's important to have these difficult discussions so we can normalize conversations about climate.</li>
 	<li>Talk to young people in your life to see what they think about the topic.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_text_separator title="4. Take action" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]
<ul>
 	<li>Remember that everything has to start somewhere. No matter the size or scale of your sustainable choices, every action has an impact.</li>
 	<li>Join a group – combatting climate change cannot be accomplished alone. There are many community groups that address climate issues. Being a part of a team can give you the support you need to stay motivated and inspired. Teams also provide greater opportunities for increased awareness and education.</li>
 	<li>Figure out what you you have to give. Do you have a bit of extra time or money? Consider volunteering or donating.</li>
 	<li>Take a look at your individual and household action and see where you can make adjustments.</li>
 	<li>Go on a <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/sustainability/">Pick-Up Walk</a> and take it as an opportunity to think and talk about climate change.

<h4><b>Opt for beef raised in Canada</b></h4>
The greatest reason for deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is clearing for cattle ranching. Purchasing beef that has been raised in Canada provides greater assurance of the agircultural practises, and also supports local community and economy.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h4><b>Refrain from buying products containing palm oil </b></h4>
The majority of the world's palm oil is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia. The demand for agicultural land for palm oil production has resulted in vast deforestation of the countries' rainforests.

Palm oil is in countless products, from candy bars to margarine to lipstick. Make sure to read labels to see which products contain palm oil and its derivitives (a.k.a palm kernel oil, palmate, palmitate).[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - Learning How to Give (and Shop!) With Cheer For All]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]The holidays can be a most wonderful time of the year and it's important, during this season of gift-giving and feasting, to be mindful that our celebrations do not come at a cost to others. There are many, easy ways that we can make sure that our merry-making is filled with decisions that are better for the environment and benefit our loved ones and our community. Take a look below for information on responsible online shopping, as well as tips and suggestions for giving the perfect gift.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="ONLINE VS. IN-STORE SHOPPING" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_single_image image="8535" img_size="full"][vc_column_text]<strong>EMISSIONS</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>When it comes to carbon emissions, there's no clear winner between online and in-store shopping. For both types, transportation is the largest contributer.</li>
 	<li>In-store shopping can be more carbon-friendly than online shopping if travel is done by walking, biking, bus, or by ensuring that shopping trips are consolidated and along routine driving routes (i.e. no special shopping trips for just a couple items).</li>
</ul>
<strong>WASTE</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Online purchasing results in significantly more waste than in-store purchases and consumers have more control over type and amount of packaging when purchases are made in-person.</li>
 	<li>When purchasing online, you can reduce the amount of waste by purchasing multiple items together and requesting that they be shipped in the same package.</li>
</ul>
<strong>LOCAL IMPACT</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Online shopping often means that an item is being purchased from outside your local community.</li>
 	<li>In-store shopping is more likely to support the local economy, local businesses, and to help build community.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.myuna.ca/2019/05/31/sustainability-tips-june/">Learn more</a> about the importance of purchasing from  local retailers.[/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]
<h4><strong>Shopping online? Follow these tips to reduce your impact. </strong></h4>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Ask yourself some questions. </strong>Is this product available from a local store? Can I get this item by walking, biking, bussing or otherwise during a drive I'm already taking?</li>
 	<li><strong>Slow it down. </strong>Opt for standard shipping, even if faster options are free. Express deliveries result in more, emptier vehicles on the road and negate the efficiencies of consolidated and optimized deliveries that online shopping can provide.</li>
 	<li><strong>Only click once. </strong>Consolidate your orders to reduce packaging and delivery waste.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don't buy multiples. </strong>If it's an item that needs to be tried on, don't buy multiples of different sizes - purchase it in a shop. High return rates significantly increase the carbon impacts of online shopping.</li>
 	<li><strong>Avoid missed deliveries. </strong>Make arrangements to be home when a package arrives, or to have items delivered to a neighbour's home.</li>
 	<li><strong>Be mindful of what you buy. </strong>Check in with yourself - are you certain that you truly want and need this product?</li>
 	<li><strong>Go to the store </strong>to purchase items with high return rates - such as shoes.</li>
</ol>
[/vc_column_text][vc_message]30% of all products ordered online are returned, compared to 9% of in-store purchases.

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - 7 Steps to a More Sustainable You!]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Thinking of making a resolution in the new year? Thought about making one that has a lasting impact on the health of the planet and your community? Making these types of changes, more often than not, will also be beneficial to your personal well-being, physical health, and lighter on your wallet.

It can be tempting to take the new year as an opportunity to make a complete over-haul of everything you would like to improve. What's often learned, is that these changes don't last. Having a plan to make impactful changes that are manageable is the best way to make resolutions that are sustainable.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="SUSTAINABILITY FITNESS PLAN" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_single_image image="8626" img_size="full"][vc_column_text]<strong>A 7-STEP SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM</strong>

A failure to plan is a plan to fail. Making a plan is the first step to success in any behaviourial changes within your life!
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Do an assessment. </strong>Take the time to do a scan of your life and your lifestyle. Where are you at now, and where would you like to be? What are the changes/improvements you would like to make?

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><strong>Reflect.</strong> Why are you making these changes? Do they allign with ethical values that are important to you? Are you hoping to reduce some of your spending? Are you feeling certain social pressures? Whatever the reason, understanding the "why" will help you keep on track and motivated.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><strong>Figure out where you have the most flexibility.</strong> Depending on different circumstances within your life (family, work, school) some changes may be more of a challenge for you than for others. Choose changes that will have high impact within less initial disruption to your life, instead of those that cause high disruption with potential less impact. Make sure that these changes can be absorbed permanently into your lifestyle.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><strong>Strengthen your sustainability muscle</strong>. While it's possible to make huge lifestyle changes, they are not always sustainable. Commit to the changes you've decided to make, but don't overdo it in the beginning. Once your habits and routines have adjusted to the initial changes, you can add on new ones. Bit by bit these behaviours that were once "changes" will just be normal routine within your life. Making changes comes through discipline, and discipline requires practice and repetition and repetition. Once your sustainability muscle is strong, what once took dedicated effort will seem second-nature.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><strong>Build and sculpt.</strong> Start to stream-line your decision making. Once you determine your choices - i.e. a particular brand of food that fulfills all the social, environmental, and economic factors that you are looking for, you can stick to it and not have to make the decision again.

<hr />

</li>
 	<li><strong>Weigh in. </strong>Check in with yourself. Did you fall off track? Why? Maybe your goals were too high, or you got distracted, or lost motivation. Understanding the "why" will help you to decide if you need to adjust your goals, or acknowledge where you fell short and come up with future solutions.

<hr />

* The majority of energy used in BC households is provided by natural gas. Purchasing 'green' natural gas ensures that with every unit of natural gas you purchase, the same amount of natural gas from a climate-friendly source is produced and put onto a pipeline. The majority of BC's electricity (95%) is sourced from Hydro - a renewable resource.

**Reducing transportation via air travel is one of the most effective ways to reduce individual carbon emissions (save for choosing to have one fewer child). When you do fly, make sure to fly economy class (more people can fit onto one plane than when people take business class) and buy carbon offsets, to offset to emissions produced by the flight.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="ARTICLE SOURCES" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]<a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/ntrlgs/rprt/cndnrsdntlntrlgsbll/index-eng.html">Canadian Energy Regulator (2020)</a>

 	<li>Experiences are more unique than a material gift</li>
 	<li>Experiences provide the gift of memories and stories to share</li>
 	<li>Experiences have been shown to foster stronger relationships than material gifts</li>
 	<li>Giving an experience reduces the risk of giving a gift that the receiver doesn't like (which can have the opposite intended effect!)</li>
 	<li>Doesn't contribute to clutter, or the material burden of owning too much 'stuff'</li>
</ul>
Note: An experience doesn't necessarily need to be shared (i.e. you don't have to be with the person) for the gift to foster feelings of closeness between the giver and the receiver.
<h4>Experiences to Give</h4>
<strong>Something playful: </strong>Bowling, Escape room, Go-karts, Arcade games, Golfing

<strong>Something solo: </strong>Massage, Spa treatment

<strong>Something interactive: </strong>Cooking class, Wine tasting, Paint night

<strong>Something cultural: </strong>Theatre or concert tickets, Trip to a museum or gallery, Sports tickets[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="A GUIDE TO GIVING GIFTS FOR VALENTINE'S DAY" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]If you are opting to give material gifts, make sure to take a moment to consider the options that are best for the receiver (is it meaningful?), the gifter (can I afford it?), the community (were all people involved in this item's production treated fairly?), and the environment (are their consequences of this item's production?)[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_separator][vc_single_image image="8918" img_size="full"][vc_separator][/vc_column][vc_column width="3/4"][vc_column_text]<strong>Say No To: ROSES</strong>

Roses are environmentally costly, both in their production and transportation. High levels of pesticides and fertilizers are required for their production, which can pollute local environments. Roses are imported primarily from South America and Africa, which requires them to be transported internationally to their consumers. Because roses are such fragile flowers, and their bloom is time and temperature-sensitive, they need to be transported by air, rather than shipped by sea, which is very carbon-intensive.

<b>Say Yes to: LIVING PLANTS AND SEASONAL FLOWERS</b>

Living plants are very popular right now and a welcome gift by many! Aloe, Snake plant, Jade plant, and Pothos are just a few examples of low maintenance house plants that even the blackest of thumbs can care for. These plants don't require much light, bring life to any room and also act to purify the air in a room.

If living plants aren't quite the right fit for the receiver, go for something seasonal. Seasonal flowers and arrangements can be bought at any farmer's market or market (such as Granville Island). If you are shopping at a flower shop, make sure you call ahead to know if they have seasonal flowers available. Most flowers that are available at grocery stores or through online delivery services will not provide seasonal/ local options.

Palm oil is an ingredient in the majority of recognizable candy bars and chocolate products. The demand for agicultural land for palm oil production has resulted in vast deforestation of rainforests, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia, where the majority of the world's palm oil is produced.

<b>Say Yes to: CHOCOLATE (FAIRTRADE &amp; RAINFOREST ALLIANCE)</b>

Choosing chocolate that is Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance certified ensures that certain environmental and ethical standards are being met throughout the entire supply chain of the products.

RainForest Alliance is an international non-profit organization that ensures farms meet sustainability requirements, including standards on biodiversity conservation, human livelihoods and well-being, natural resources conservation, and effective planning and farm management systems.

Fairtrade is a certification that ensures farmers are given fair prices and workers are provided with decent working and living conditions.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_separator][vc_single_image image="8916" img_size="full"][vc_separator][/vc_column][vc_column width="3/4"][vc_column_text]<strong>Say No to: NEW JEWELLRY (WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY)</strong>

Mined metals and precious stones used for jewellry manufacturing (particularly in the diamond industry) are known for social conflict, as well as impact on the environment. To avoid the social and ethical effects of the fine jewellry industry, it is best to avoid purchasing items from manufacturers that do not have transparency throughout their entire supply chain (resource extraction, production, distribution).  While there are third-party certifications that strive to control the harmful effects of the industry (such as the Kimberley Process, for diamonds), the efficacy of these certificates has been debated.

<strong>Say Yes to: VINTAGE, PREVIOUSLY-LOVED, AND ETHICAL JEWELLRY</strong>

Local jewellers often have greater transparency surrounding the material extraction and manufacturing of their products. They also often have strong commitments towards ethical sources when they do use materials that historically run a risk of contributing to harmful social and environmental systems.

Purchasing previously-loved jewellry removes the majority of concerns regarding environmental and ethical consequences. As the money you are spending is not 'voting' in support of the original manufacturer, it is also not supporting the extraction and manufacturing practices.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="ARTICLE SOURCES" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]<a href="https://files.fairtrade.net/publications/2018_LifeCycleCutRoses.pdf">Alig and Frischknect (2018)</a>

		<title><![CDATA[UNA Lunar New Year event to proceed as planned following Vancouver Coastal Health advice]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The University Neighbourhoods Association (UNA) has received messages of concern from the community regarding the impact of the new coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan, China on the UNA’s <a href="https://www.myuna.ca/2020/01/21/lunar-new-year-celebration-2020/">Lunar New Year Celebration</a> this Saturday, January 25, 2020.

The UNA reached out to the department of Health Protection/Communicable Disease Control at Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) to seek advice regarding those concerns. VCH advised that it is safe to continue this year’s event and other activities as normal.

The representative from VCH referred the UNA and residents to the following resources for more information:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.vch.ca/about-us/news/vancouver-coastal-health-statement-on-coronavirus">Vancouver Coastal Health: Statement on coronavirus</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-coronavirus">BC Centre for Disease Control: Information on novel coronavirus</a></li>
</ul>
For general safety during any event, the UNA asks that if you are feeling sick, you can help protect others by doing the following:
<ul>
 	<li>stay home while sick</li>
 	<li>avoid close contact with others</li>
 	<li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands</li>
 	<li>clean and disinfect objects and surfaces</li>
</ul>
For questions and concerns about the coronavirus, please talk to your physician or healthcare provider, or refer to the health authorities listed below:

<h4 style="text-align: center;">How we choose to dress ourselves has impact that goes far beyond personal functionality and image.</h4>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<p style="text-align: center;">The modern-day fashion climate has shifted heavily towards inexpensive, short-lived products and styles, that enable increased production, consumption, and disposal of clothing. The increased rate at which fashion collections turnover, and at which individuals are buying and getting rid of clothing has resulted in profound, unseen impacts on the environment, the economy, and especially on human health and well-being. This article discusses the true impacts of the modern-day textile industry and provides steps that we can take towards a wardrobe that is healthier for us, our planet, and all those impacted.</p>

[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>Fast Fashion: </b>A system in which inexpensive clothing is produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to latest trends. A fast fashion system, requiring minimal expense and production time, allows firms to react quickly to changing consumer demand by replenishing inventory and introducing more fashion styles.

Total greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the textiles industry is 1.2 billion tonnes annually (more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined).<sup>2</sup>

Hazardous substance released during textile production affect the environment. <sup>2</sup>

Fast fashion tends towards synthetic materials, which can be produced more rapidly and release plastic microfibers resulting in half a million tonnes of ocean pollution every year.<sup>2</sup>[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>Ethical</strong>

Many textile workers are subject to unsafe working environments and the hazardous substance used and released during production unfair wages.

Having too many clothing options can increase anxiety, resulting from the paradox of choice (having too many options to choose from).<sup>3</sup>

Clutter, resulting from too many clothes can also cause an increase in anxiety.<sup>4</sup>

The human health risks of a significant number of chemicals used to turn raw materials into textiles are unknown. <sup>2</sup>[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>It takes more time</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><del>We have been closely monitoring the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) based on the information from local, provincial and national health partners. At this time,</del> the Public Health Agency of Canada has deemed the public health risk associated with the virus as “low for Canada.” As such, <b>Spring Break Camps are scheduled to continue as planned.</b></span></span>

We have increased preventative measures to reduce the spread of germs in our facilities, including cleaning and disinfecting the high-touch point areas regularly and adding educational signage in visible areas.

In addition, we will introduce preventative measures during camp sessions:

As recommended by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/guidance-schools-childcare-programs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Government of Canada</a>, camp staff will be reinforcing a variety of behaviours to reduce the spread of any germs while at camp. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Doing extra hand-washing breaks, especially before any snacks or meal times. Additionally, camp staff will have access to hand-sanitizer to share with campers as needed.</li>
 	<li>Encouraging campers to keep hands away from their mouth, eyes, and nose.</li>
 	<li>Encouraging campers to cough or sneeze into their elbow/sleeve.</li>
 	<li>Reducing camp activities that involve “high-fives” or close personal contact (i.e. the human knot).</li>

</span>[/vc_message][vc_column_text]<del>With growing concerns about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the University Neighbourhoods Association (UNA) would like to update the UNA community, partners and clients on actions we are taking in response.</del>

<del>From the onset of COVID-19 in B.C., the UNA has been following the lead of Canadian public health authorities. For now, the B.C. Ministry of Health has assessed that the risk to British Columbians remains low and the UNA encourages you to follow the advice of health authorities. We will provide a list of health authorities at the end of this update.</del>

<del>The safety of community members who use our facilities is a top priority of the UNA. UNA community centres (Wesbrook Community Centre and the Old Barn Community Centre) are cleaned and sanitized on a daily basis. We have also introduced enhanced cleaning protocols for these facilities and focused disinfection of high-touch areas including door handles, countertops and bathrooms. We are providing additional cleaning supplies in activity rooms and ask that users continue to wipe down equipment once they are finished. Posters emphasizing proper hand hygiene can be found throughout the centres.</del>

<del>Currently, all community centre programming will run as usual. However, in this time of uncertainty, we want to be flexible with refunds and cancellations. We will waive our current cancellation policies in the interim for spring break camps, room bookings, field bookings and birthday parties. We want to make sure that you are not penalized for ensuring your family’s health and well being.</del>

<del>At the advice of the B.C. Ministry of Health, we will be cancelling any events of more than 250 people until further notice and, as such, are cancelling Easter at the Barn (April 13) and our Earth Day celebration (April 18). We will provide further updates regarding events scheduled in May.</del>

<del>The UNA continues to ask community members and community centre users to help protect others. If you are feeling sick or exhibiting flu-like symptoms, please refrain from visiting UNA facilities.</del>

<del>The UNA is working to protect our staff by putting in place an extended work-from-home policy and other new employment policies.</del>

<del>We will continue to monitor this situation closely and provide the community with further updates as needed.</del>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Spring Programs Cancelled]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<div>

The UNA has cancelled all Spring Programs in accordance with public health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Beginning on March 27, the UNA staff will start to refund registration fees in full. Refunds will be made directly to your accounts.

Refunds for Winter Programs, including pro-rated refunds for programs that were cancelled before the session was finalized, are now completed.

Currently, there are no changes to <a tabindex="-1" title="" href="https://www.myuna.ca/recreation/programs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Programs</a>. Online registration for summer programs and summer camps will begin on May 25. However, we recognize that in these times, we must remain flexible and will reassess our programming in the coming weeks.

In addition to current facility closures, service suspensions, and the closure of all playgrounds, the UNA has also closed the Brockhouse Park Community Field and the Nobel Park Softball Diamond, effective March 23. These measures are necessary in order to adhere to public health advice for social distancing.

<strong>What is Social or Physical Distancing?</strong>

Social distancing, also known as physical distancing, involves keeping a distance of two metres from others. The <a tabindex="-1" title="" href="http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/common-questions?utm_source=UNA+Staff+List&amp;utm_campaign=f671088ff0-UNAAllstaffmeetingTaxForms_2020_03_06_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_6a43ceebd1-f671088ff0-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B.C. Centre for Disease Control </a>says; "Social distancing is a way that we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting close contact with others. Even though we are not sick, we should still keep about two meters (six feet) or the length of a queen-sized bed from one another when we can when outside our homes."

For questions about UNA facilities or services, please contact <a tabindex="-1" title="" href="https://www.myuna.ca/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>UNA staff </strong></a>who are all now working from their homes.

		<title><![CDATA[Sustainability Tips - Celebrate Spring and Explore Gardening at Home]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
<p style="text-align: center;">How we walk through the world today looks a bit different than it normally does this time of year. However, the spring is still a time to enjoy being outside, to celebrate the breaking of winter, and to look forward to new growth and longer days. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, an annual celebration of the Earth and life on this planet. With the coming of many spring celebrations that will take a different form this year, we are re-discovering ways that we can continue to celebrate, appreciate and find joy in the world around us. From taking daily walks through a community garden, to growing plants at home, this season is the perfect time to find comfort in the new life growing outside of and within our homes.</p>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow."</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>- Audrey Hepburn</strong></p>
[/vc_column_text][vc_text_separator title="WELCOME TO THE GARDEN" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_single_image image="9309" img_size="full"][vc_column_text]While many of us are staying home, during this time of physical distancing, it's important and advised that we continue to get outside every day, for our mental and physical well-being. Getting outside and connecting with plants, natural landscapes, wilderness, and animals all have powerfully positive effects on our health and well-being<sup>1</sup>.

Have you been to the four community gardens in the UNA neighbourhoods? The three gardens in Hawthorn Place, and one in Wesbrook place provide a place of solace and calm, to anyone who cares to stop by for a visit. With the coming of spring, things are getting busy, as birds are building nests, sprouts are shooting up, and pollinators will soon be seen buzzing amongst blossoms.

When you take your daily walk, consider visiting the gardens. If you aren't sure where the gardens are, take a look at the map on the Community Garden <a href="http://www.myuna.ca/gardens">website.</a>

<strong>FINDING CONNECTION AT THE OLD BARN CHILDREN'S GARDEN</strong>

If you are looking for ways to be outside and find some deeper connection with the natural world, there is still opportunity to do so at the Old Barn Children's Garden. The garden is a collective-garden, that welcomes all ages and levels of experience. While the structure of volunteering has recently changed, to practice physical distancing, volunteers can still working independently in the garden, or with members of their household. For more information, you can email communitygardens@myuna.ca.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>SCAVENGER HUNT IN THE GARDENS!</b>

Looking for an activity to do with kids when you're out for a walk? Try out this scavenger hunt to learn about the natural world and explore the gardens.

Mindfulness meditation, a form of meditation that pays attention to the present moment, is known for its many psychological benefits, including decreased stress and anxiety.<sup>2 </sup>Mindfullness can be practiced throughout everyday life, and if you are looking to find a moment of calmness, a great place to start is in a garden.

<strong>Observing the Five Senses </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Take a seat or stand in a quiet place</li>
 	<li>Take a deep breath</li>
 	<li>Observe and identify <strong>four things that you can see</strong></li>
 	<li>Take a deep breath</li>
 	<li>Observe and identify <strong>three things that you can hear</strong></li>
 	<li>Take a deep breath</li>
 	<li>Observe and identify <strong>two things that you can smell</strong></li>
 	<li>Take a deep breath</li>
 	<li>Observe and identify <strong>one thing that you can taste </strong></li>
 	<li>Take the biggest breath you've taken all day</li>
</ul>
This meditation can be done alone and in silence, or can be done with others and is a lot of fun to practice with children![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="GROWING AT HOME" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]There are countless benefits to physical and psychological well-being and health that come, not only through the physical act of gardening, but also by simply being in the presence of plants<sup>3,4</sup>. Plants also improve air quality and can mitigate the effects of sick building syndrome (commonly seen in office environments, but can also occur at home). They've even been shown to improve productivity in work environments<sup>5,6</sup>, which may be useful when many of us find ourselves working at home.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>INDOOR GARDENING</b>[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image="9311" img_size="medium"][vc_column_text]There are so many ways that you can grow plant-life at home, all of them requiring little to no experience, and often no more supplies than what you have hanging around your home.

As we are spending more time at home, it can be challenging for parents to find activites and fun things to keep their kid’s occupied and engaged. As it’s become important to only leave the house when necessary, this is a great opportunity to get a little creative when it comes to using what we have in our homes. The Seattle Times has come up with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/at-home-with-kids-because-of-coronavirus-closures-here-are-23-fun-activities-using-stuff-you-already-have/">23 Activities to Do with Kids with Stuff You Already Have.</a>[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>HOME GARDENING FOR LITTLE ONES</strong>

While all gardening can be done with kids, sometimes it's fun and more rewarding to have their own project. Check out these mini-growing projects that allows kids to explore how plants grow and see their own plant-life progress each day.

		<title><![CDATA[Temporary Daycare at the Old Barn]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[The Old Barn Community Centre has transformed some of its space into a temporary, full-day daycare, which opened this week. This childcare service is for those who need it most, with priority given to children whose parents perform essential services during the pandemic. Operated by the YMCA, the daycare is open Monday to Friday between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.

The YMCA considers the health and well-being of children, families and staff as a top priority. From the onset of COVID-19 in our province, the YMCA has been committed to continuing to provide child care to families as long it was feasible and aligned with the recommendations of the government agencies.

As its child care programs continue to operate, the YMCA is carrying out the following enhanced health measures in compliance with public health:
<ul>
 	<li>If a child or staff has had symptoms recently, such as fever, sore throat, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, they must self-isolate for 10 days from the onset of the symptoms before returning to child care;</li>
 	<li>Health screenings are being carried out and all families are asked to complete a Health Declaration Form at drop-off/sign-in each day. This is done at the main entrance thereby restricting access by parents to the program space;</li>
 	<li>If anyone develops symptoms or has a fever during a program, they will be asked to self-isolate for 10 days before returning to the YMCA program;</li>
 	<li>Regular hand washing for children and staff is taking place throughout the day; and</li>
 	<li>Enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of high-touch surfaces is completed at regular intervals.</li>
</ul>
The temporary YMCA daycare will be open until public school resumes or there is a provincial directive to close all daycare services.

The UNA is pleased to be able to support our community and its residents in as many ways as we can during these extraordinary times.

		<title><![CDATA[Healthy Seniors, Resilient Community]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[In early March 2020, the UNA received the approval from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) for a total of funding of $14,125 to support the seniors’ <em><strong>Your Passport to Well-being Project (Phase II)</strong></em>. The project is a continuation of<em><strong> Your Passport to Well-being Project (Phase I)</strong></em> to promote seniors’ physical strength, mental health, and social well-being with a completion deadline of March 31, 2021.

On April 1, EDSC issued a new announcement that allows the funding to be used to assist seniors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To align with the ESDC’s new recommendations, we have decided to redirect the funding to a new initiative called<em><strong> Healthy Seniors, Resilient Community</strong></em> that will support the present needs of seniors in our community as well as the forthcoming programs for our seniors community.

The examples of use of the funding include (but are not limited to) those that:
<ul>
 	<li>promote computer literacy and virtual activities among seniors;</li>
 	<li>support seniors who are self-isolating at home, including the delivery of grocery, food and medication;</li>
 	<li>assist seniors to undertake essential activities, such as visits to the doctor;</li>
 	<li>provide information to seniors regarding how to care for themselves during the pandemic;</li>
 	<li>prevent seniors’ social isolation in a time of recommended social distancing / self-quarantine through connection by phone and via online apps such as FaceTime and Zoom;</li>
 	<li>support the ability of seniors to stay connected with their community and their family through technology.</li>
</ul>
We would like to connect seniors who have immediate needs that this funding may be able to support, also to get feedback on what activities and programs will benefit the collective health and well-being of seniors in our community.

All requests and suggestions will be assessed on an on-going basis and responded timely at our best capacity.

Please fill in <strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/healthyseniors">THIS SURVEY</a></strong>, we will contact you shortly once we receive your response.

Please contact <a href="mailto:programs@myuna.ca">programs@myuna.ca</a>, if you have any questions.]]></content>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">April showers bring May flowers...from 5000 km away?</h4>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]The flower industry is complicated. There are many parties involved, with the Netherlands playing a major role in wholesale trading and breeding and an increasing amount of production migrating to the southern hemisphere. These countries, primarily Columbia, Ecuador, and Kenya, have the climate for fast flower production, and cheaper labour costs. Because of the many stakeholders involved in the production and trade of flowers, understanding the true impact of the industry becomes challenging.[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<b>A short history on the bouquet </b>

The oldest evidence of flowers arranged in bouquets comes from Ancient Egypt. There is also a history in Japan and China; flower arranging was a refined art-form centered around a belief that all life, including plants, was sacred (cut flowers were used sparingly). Bouquets eventually made an appearance in The Netherlands in the 18th century, where lavish arrangements were used as displays of wealth. The more familiar tradition of gifting flowers as an expression of sentiment was popularized in the Victorian era.

<strong>Cut-flowers and bouquets today</strong>

Today, the $8.5 billion floral industry continues to be dominated by the Netherlands, which has been the heart of the trade for the last 200 years.<sup>1</sup>

The many hands through which a single flower can pass makes traceability challenging and, along with the lack of data, a calculation of total impact near to impossible.[/vc_column_text][vc_message message_box_color="success" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-shopping-bag"]Are you interested in knowing how to buy flowers with the most positive social, environmental, and economic impact? Skip to the bottom and read 'Selecting Sustainable Blooms'.[/vc_message][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="Impacts of the Flower Industry" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_single_image image="9435" img_size="medium"][vc_column_text]
<h5><strong>Environmental Impacts</strong></h5>
<strong>Emissions</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Once a flower has been cut, it enters a 'cold-chain' in which it is dry-packed and kept at a temperature close to 0<strong>°</strong>C until the moment it reaches the customer. The specific condition requirements (temperature, humidity, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> levels) increases the already high energy requirements for long-distance transportation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pollution</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Flowers are non-edible, and therefore do not have the pesticide restrictions imposed on them, which means producers can use more liberal amounts to ensure their product is not damaged.</li>
 	<li>Pesticides can run-off and pollute local environments, especially local drinking-water. <sup>2</sup></li>
 	<li>International trading of flowers results in higher pesticide use, due to pest control protocols when crossing borders.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Land-use</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>In some countries, such as Kenya, the rapid increase of demands from the floral industry has resulted in deforestation of untouched forests to increase agricultural production space and also to accommodate increases in the population size due to flower farm employment.<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h5><strong>Social Impacts</strong></h5>
The poverty and poor working conditions at flower farms in developing nations have been reported on for many years. While there have been improvements, especially in the case of the creation of certification programmes (i.e. Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, Verifora) to ensure that ethical and environmental standards are being complied with and enforced, the industry continues to be criticized for its poor labour standards.<sup>3</sup>[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]
<h5><strong>Economic Impacts</strong></h5>
There are many benefits to local communities, with the presence of the flower trade.  The cut flower industry is the principal employer for many local workers in some developing nations, such as Kenya who's second-largest export is cut flowers (greater than coffee, less than tea).<sup>4 </sup>The flower industry employs hundreds of thousands in Kenya alone. The industry also gives people, especially women, in rural areas with small amounts of land an opportunity to grow a cash crop.<sup>3</sup>

While this economic impact can be substantial, the flower market - like its product - is fragile. While it can be argued that industry bolsters employment in developing nations and reduces dependence on aid, it's a vulnerable industry and subject to many uncontrollable factors, such as oil prices, climate change, as well as the economic situation in target markets.[/vc_column_text][vc_message icon_fontawesome="fa fa-plane"]In 2018, Canada imported close to $50 million worth of cut flowers.<sup>5</sup>[/vc_message][vc_column_text][/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_text_separator title="The Industry Amidst a 'Covid' Climate" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_column_text]In this time of global pandemic, weddings are being postponed, florists are closing up shop, and grocery stores are putting all priority on stocking food staples and essential items. As these changes have happened across the world, the effects are being felt from the flower fields to the auction houses, to the local flower shops.

Last month, one of the largest floral auction houses in the world (through which 40% of the world's flowers pass) destroyed 70% of its supply due to the drop in demand and is predicting a cumulative loss of $2 billion locally.<sup>6</sup> As sales continue to remain low, the impact will eventually ripple to the beginning of the line, and flower farms across the world will be forced to lay off hundreds of thousands of workers.[/vc_column_text][vc_message icon_fontawesome="fa fa-trash"]Demand for blossoms has crashed, due to COVID-19, and flower growers are throwing away flowers by the billions.[/vc_message][vc_text_separator title="Selecting Sustainable Blooms" title_align="separator_align_left"][vc_single_image image="9439" img_size="medium"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<strong>CHOOSING WHERE YOUR FLOWERS COME FROM </strong>

If you opt for a last-minute bouquet at the grocery store, it's unlikely that a store attendant will be able to tell you where those flowers were grown. A single flower typically travels thousands of miles and crosses multiple borders before they land at their final destination, and there is often little to no traceability. Going to a local flower shop is the best way to ensure that your purchase has a positive impact on the place where it was grown, and every hand it has passed through.
<ul>
 	<li>Best Option: Choose locally grown flowers</li>
 	<li>Second Best Option: Choose domestically-grown flowers (grown in Canada)</li>
 	<li>Third Best Option: Choose imported flowers that are Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, or Veriflora Certified</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_message message_box_color="success" icon_fontawesome="fa fa-heart-o"]Flowers are a perfect way to share our love and sentiment with friends and family that we are missing. They make people smile, have positive effects on mood<sup>7</sup>, and purchasing them helps to support local businesses that are currently struggling to stay afloat. Most local flower shops that are still open are offering online ordering and contact-free delivery.[/vc_message][vc_column_text]<strong>WHY SEASONAL FLOWERS FROM A LOCAL SHOP ARE THE WAY TO GO</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>They are fresher, do not lose their scent, and last longer because the time between the clip and the customer is usually a matter of days (vs. imported flowers, which is weeks)</li>
 	<li>A local florist is more likely to be able to personalize a bouquet to what you are looking for, and will be able to make substitutions if you request seasonal and locally grown flowers</li>
 	<li>It helps the local economy, by supporting the florist, the grower, as well as all their suppliers and clients and those along the supply chain</li>
 	<li>They didn't have to travel very far (fewer emissions)</li>
 	<li>Purchasing from growers and shops that supply seasonal and local flowers, are more likely to also make other considerations for the environment</li>
 	<li>Seasonal flowers can support local biodiversity</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<strong>TIPS ON BUYING LOCAL FLOWERS </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Give the internet a quick search for nearby local florists. Give their website a glance over or call them up to see if they source local and seasonal flowers.</li>
 	<li>When purchasing a bouquet, request that all imported blossoms be substituted with local/seasonal ones.</li>
 	<li>Ask that paper wrapping and raffia be used in place of cellophane and plastic ribbons.</li>
 	<li>If the bouquet comes in vases and you/the recipient already has one, request extra flowers instead!</li>
